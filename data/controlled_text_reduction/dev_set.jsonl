Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., described Gilbert as \"a great hurricane ... in the top 10 percent (historically) as far as intensity, size and destructive potential.\"\nOnly two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _\na 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida, and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.\n\"The people who

<highlight_start>radio ham operator<highlight_end> in the Virgin Islands, said he spoke Tuesday with Dave Porter, an American staying in <highlight_start>the Wyndham Hotel on Jamaica's Montego Bay<highlight_end>.\n\"Porter reported that the hotel `peeled apart like a banana' when the force of Hurricane Gilbert hit last night,\" Schoenbaum said.\n\"This morning he says there is just nothing

Porter told him <highlight_start>people who were trying to enter the hotel<highlight_end> on their hands and knees <highlight_start>at the height of the storm were swept into the

the fate of the <highlight_start>sprinter<highlight_end> who failed the drug test.\nReturning to Canada on Tuesday, Johnson, <highlight_start>26<highlight_end>, dodged reporters and the public, refusing to talk about <highlight_start>the muscle-building and illegal steroid Stanzolol found in his system<highlight_end> after he won <highlight_start>the 100-meter dash<highlight_end> as the world's fastest human.\nBut on the flight from South Korea, he denied using the drugs even though Olympic officials said the results were indisputable.\n\"I got nothing to hide,\" Johnson told The Boston Globe during the flight to New York, where he then boarded another plane for Canada.\n\"I don't want to tell no names, but <highlight_start>somebody's smiling today<highlight_end>.\"\n\"It's

one of 200 people on hand when Johnson's plane landed.\n\"If he had come home with the gold in tact, there would have been a million people here,\" Plaxton said.\nChaos spoiled a gilt-edged moment for a man who had run 100 meters in the <highlight_start>fastest time ever, 9.79 seconds<highlight_end>.\nJohnson, surrounded by a phalanx of security guards, ducked into a car and made a mad dash for the door when he arrived at the house.\nBut he apparently forgot his key and had to return 20 minutes later with his shirt over his head.\nJohnson spent the 1 hour, 40 minute flight from New York in the plane's cockpit to avoid reporters.\nOn the way to New York, however, he stayed in the passenger cabin, appearing calm throughout the flight, the Globe said.\nAs passengers realized who he was, some sought autographs.\nA group of flight attendants swarmed around Johnson for a photo.\n\"First I was shocked, but after a while, I don't care,\" Johnson said when asked what he felt after he was informed he had failed the drug test.\nIn Canada, a parade in his adopted hometown was canceled, and promoters backed out of deals or announced their ties with the sprinter would expire quietly.\nSports Minister Jean Charest said <highlight_start>Johnson<highlight_end> had <highlight_start>tested negative for drugs in August and<highlight_end> had <highlight_start>passed eight tests in two years.<highlight_end>\nHe called the stripping of the medal a \"national embarrassment.\"\nJohnson's family and close friends also denied he took steroids \"I know my son doesn't take drugs.\nI know he hasn't done it.\nI know it,\" said <highlight_start>his father, Ben Johnson Sr., from Falmouth, Jamaica<highlight_end>, in an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail.\n\"Ben loved mom too

gold to his mother, Gloria<highlight_end>, and the Canadian people.\n<highlight_start>It was surrendered<highlight_end> to Canadian Olympic officials before the family left South Korea on Monday.\n\"Right now he's just relieved to be resting at home.\nHe wants to be with people who love him now, not the hypocrites who abandoned him,\" Ms. Rodney said outside her mother's house.\n\"He

<highlight_start>said no steroids were dispensed<highlight_end>.\n\"I never gave him any, and he never told me he took any,\" Astaphan said in an interview in a baggage claim area.\nHundreds of Canadians rallied to the sprinter's side.\nPolice escorted a woman to the door of Johnson's mother's home so she could deliver a card with more than 1,000 signatures from Canadians \"who sympathized with your personal devastation.\"\nIn Toronto, a group of restaurant employees chipped in about $350 to charter a plane that circled the city with a banner proclaiming: \"We believe you, Ben.\"\nIn

Steven Karalekas.\nThe explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which extends six decks down into the ship.\n<highlight_start>There were 11 survivors<highlight_end> inside the turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said.\n<highlight_start>Two of the surviving crewmen of No<highlight_end>. <highlight_start>2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret<highlight_end> as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets, the Navy said.\n<highlight_start>The No. 2 turret<highlight_end> was in the same position as when <highlight_start>the explosion<highlight_end> occurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated.\nThe center gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed.\nWhen the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers by those on the dock, but <highlight_start>all remained silent<highlight_end> as the ship pulled into the pier.\nThe somber mood was heightened by the lack of bands, and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked.\nAdm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was on the dock to greet the vessel.\nAs it docked, three Marines raised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.\nThe Navy <highlight_start>kept the news media<highlight_end> about 300 yards <highlight_start>from the families<highlight_end>, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families <highlight_start>or the crewmen<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>The<highlight_end> violence and power of the turret <highlight_start>explosion was shown in<highlight_end> an amateur <highlight_start>videotape released<highlight_end> by the Navy <highlight_start>on Sunday.<highlight_end>\nThe tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.\nThe detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber \"bloomers\" that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.\nThe videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret.\nThroughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen.\n\"We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way,\" said Cmdr.\nJohn L.

the human family as one.\"\nOn Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people.\nThe families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend.\nNone of the victims listed the Norfolk area as their hometown.\nThe explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico.\nThe Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired.\nThe guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.\nThe Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.\nBut Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 <highlight_start>gun<highlight_end>'s <highlight_start>breech open<highlight_end> and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The New York Times reported Sunday.\nThis indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were still being loaded into the gun, the Times said, citing unidentified sources.\nNavy gunnery officers <highlight_start>believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun<highlight_end>, the newspaper said.\nThey said <highlight_start>flame

complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.\nThe Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War.\nThey were recommissioned by the Reagan administration in the 1980s.\nDefense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the administration <highlight_start>plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet<highlight_end> despite the explosion.\n\"They are effective, they were relatively cheap to bring <highlight_start>back into the service<highlight_end> compared to new ships, they are good cruise missile platforms, so I think they do have a role to play,\" Cheney said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\nCritics have charged that the battleship's 16-inch guns are antiquated and dangerous;

The No. 2 turret was in the same position as when the explosion occurred, facing right with the left and right guns elevated. The center gun, where the blast occurred, was depressed. When the 887-foot vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers by those on the dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier. The somber mood was heightened by the lack of bands, and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked. Adm. Powell Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was on the dock to greet the vessel. As it docked, three Marines raised a flag to half-mast at the stern of the ship.

Throughout the Norfolk area, churches dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families of Iowa crewmen. \"We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way,\" said Cmdr. John L. Fitzgerald, a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station. \"Our faith helps us to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death.\" A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar. Fitzgerald said the Iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost Soviet submarine \"put political differences aside and unite the human family as one.\" On Monday morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate 3,000 people. The families of the victims were invited, but Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend. None of the victims listed the Norfolk area as their hometown.  . The Pentagon said it happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired. The guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles. The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret. But Navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there, The New York Times reported Sunday. This indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were still being loaded into the gun, the Times said, citing unidentified sources. Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said. They said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off. The Iowa and its sister ships, the battleships Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War. They were recommissioned by the Reagan administration in the 1980s. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that the administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet despite the explosion. \"They are effective, they were relatively cheap to bring back into the service compared to new ships, they are good cruise missile platforms, so I think they do have a role to play,\" Cheney said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Critics have charged that the battleship's 16-inch guns are antiquated and dangerous; gunners say they are among the most accurate available."}

spokesman Ron Wise said.\nMiss Ball's family requested that any flowers sent to the Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients.\nMiss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was critically ill.\nFollowing her operation last week, her first words to her daughter, Lucie, were: \"Wouldn't you know _\nthis is the day I was going to get my hair done.\"\nMiss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so her death came as a shock.\n\"She had been walking, her spirits were up.\nHer family was with her,\" Wise said.\n\"She responded as well as anyone could respond to that kind of surgery.\"\nHe said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden pain in her back, and in a matter of seconds went into a full cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta.\n<highlight_start>Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in \"I Love Lucy\" from 1951 to 1957<highlight_end>.\nIn <highlight_start>the ground-breaking show, still

<highlight_start>said actress-comedian Jane Curtin<highlight_end>, star of the sitcom \"Kate and Allie.\"\n\"But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her shows.\"\n<highlight_start>The show, one of the most popular in television<highlight_end> history, was distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls.\n\"Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in comedy,\" recalled Joan Rivers.\n\"What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime.\"\n<highlight_start>Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said<highlight_end>: \"Lucy was great because she represented every person.\nShe showed us human foibles and gave us a chance to laugh at ourselves.\"\nMiss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the \"I Love Lucy\" characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant.\n\"That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant,\" Miss Goldberg said.\n\"She was looking at him in a compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously.\nAnd that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy.\"\nBob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of \"I Love Lucy\" on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words \"In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989\" appeared.\n\"I felt I had lost someone in my family.\nI couldn't believe it,\" said Rosati, 40.\n\"I was watching Lucy like I do every morning.\nShe's one of the most-admired ladies in this town.\"\nHe was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside Miss Ball's home on Roxbury Drive as florists delivered baskets of flowers to the house.\nTour vans passed by in a non-stop procession.\nOn Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flower arrangements were placed on Miss Ball's two stars _\none for her film work, one for television.\nBudd Friedman, owner of the Improvisation comedy clubs, said, \"The world of comedy has lost its first lady.\nHer death is an irreparable loss ... to our industry.\"\nActor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series \"Taxi.\"\n\"It made it like it had been blessed,\" he recalled.\n<highlight_start>Admirers included President Bush<highlight_end>, in Southern California at the time of <highlight_start>Miss Ball<highlight_end>'s passing, <highlight_start>and former President Reagan<highlight_end>.\n\"Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American institution,\" the former president and Nancy Reagan said in a statement.\n\"Just the mention of her name brings a smile. ...\nWe love Lucy and will miss her deeply.\"\n\"Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter,\" Bush said.\n\"But she also embodied an even greater treasure _\nthe gift of love.\nShe appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit.\nShe was not merely an actress or comedienne.\nShe was Lucy and she was loved.\"\n\"To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing,\" said \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after \"I Love Lucy\" went off the air as a regular series.\n\"She didn't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life.\"\nSaid comic Tim Conway: \"We're going to miss this lady, but not really, because she's still here.\nAll those wonderful things they did together ... those wonderful TV shows ... are still available.\"\nAlthough Miss Ball hadn't visited <highlight_start>her hometown of Jamestown, N.Y<highlight_end>, since 1956 and had no family there, <highlight_start>she had stayed in touch with friends<highlight_end>.\nIrene Rosseti, who now lives in Celoron, N.Y., said Miss Ball recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th

signs for eventual reunification would have to come from Washington and Moscow.\nDuring a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said that reunification is a \"matter for the Germans to decide.\"\nBut he added: \"If that (reunification) was worked out between the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western interests.\"\nFor his part, <highlight_start>Gorbachev

<highlight_start>we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,\" wrote commentator Peter Jenkins<highlight_end> in London's The Independent.\n\"The Cold War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.\"\nWilly Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the East as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn't necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a \"hypothesis that cannot be excluded.\"\nAs talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the country in near-record numbers.\n<highlight_start>More<highlight_end> than 100,000 <highlight_start>East Germans are expected to resettle in West Germany<highlight_end> this year, leaving a gaping hole in the Communist nation's work force.\nLittle is likely to change in East Germany as long as the 77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power.\nDuring a September 1987 visit to Bonn, <highlight_start>Honecker called respect for Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace.\n\"Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire and water,\"<highlight_end> Honecker added on the issue of reunification.\nThere are virtually no indications that Honecker's successors will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the capitalist West.\nThe calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the country that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery.\n\"After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations,\" member of Parliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits.\nThe renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly prophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German state governor who later went on to head the centrist Free Democratic Party.\n\"Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness.\nTired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not to disturb her sleep,\" Maier predicted in 1955.\n\"The lioness will one day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.\"\nStill, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip by Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: \"I love Germany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.\"", "gold_summary": "With growing numbers of disgruntled East Germans emigrating to West Germany, the idea of reunification seems possible and is being seriously discussed.\nMost West German officials and President Bush support the idea.\nSoviet and East German leaders oppose it, Honecker much more strongly than Gorbachev.\nThroughout the rest of Europe unification scenarios are being considered and discussed by officials and media commentators.\nRecalling Nazi Germany's sordid past, some express a mistrust toward uniting a Germany that could become Europe's economic powerhouse with almost 80 million people.\nStill others believe we ought not be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions.",

thousands of refugees fleeing Honecker's hard-line Communist rule for the capitalist West has revived international interest in the debate. Once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream, the idea a public nod from President Bush and something short of a categorical \"no\" from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev The West German constitution calls for a united Germany but it has not been a paramount concern Full national reunification would completey rework the postwar European order mapped out by the conquering Allies prospect creates unease in Britain and France, and in Poland reunification the economic center of gravity would be shifted with a powerhouse of 80 million", "unhighlights_concatenation": "Three decades ago, a West German politician said German reunification was a \"sleeping lioness\" that would awake one day with a mighty roar. Now, there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate Europe. \"Reunification is coming closer, but I can't say whether it will take 10, 15 or 20 years,\" says West German conservative lawmaker Eduard Lintner. \"We have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago.\"   East German leader Erich   of German reunification has gotten   of the Soviet Union. The idea makes East German leaders virtually apopletic. \"If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany,\" added the 44-year-old Lintner in an Associated Press interview.   of the West Germans in the years since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at the end of World War II.  . It is a   that   in the East bloc. London's prestigious Sunday Times on Sept. 10 mapped out a possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in Europe, Honecker's death and further Westernization of Poland and Hungary. \"Moscow unilaterally abolishes the Warsaw Pact after guarantees from Poland and Hungary they will not join other alliances,\" the Times' futuristic view continued. \"West Germany withdraws from NATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes for   and neutrality.\" That sort of talk is being heard more and more as Moscow loosens its hold on the East bloc and countries like the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary explore democratic reforms. The implications of pulling down the Berlin Wall and other barriers to link the two German states are enormous and, for many, ominous. As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in 1992,   even further to the German side   nearly   people _ 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans. West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, and despite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of many Soviet bloc neighbors. A unified Germany could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux, as democratic movements sweep parts of the Soviet bloc. Older generations recall eerie echoes of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's boasting that he had brought about \"the unity of the German nation.\" Eva Kulesza, head of research for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at the French Institute of International Relations, says she believes that \"as far as public opinion there is new sort of mistrust toward Germany. This new fear of Germany is linked to German economic trends.\" \"Germany is much stronger, much more dynamic than France,\" she added. Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from Washington and Moscow. During a news conference last week in Montana, Bush said that reunification is a \"matter for the Germans to decide.\" But he added: \"If that (reunification) was worked out between the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western interests.\" For his part, Gorbachev evaded the issue during a news conference in Bonn in June, saying only, \"the situation in Europe today was determined by historical realities.\" Outside Germany, political leaders and commentators have been sharply divided on the issue. \"In thinking about the German Question, we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and out-of-date assumptions,\" wrote commentator Peter Jenkins in London's The Independent. \"The Cold War was conducted in the name of freedom and, today, if the coming of freedom to East Germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the Federal Republic, we ought not to be opposed.\" Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who sought greater ties to the East as chancellor in the 1970s, said German unity doesn't necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a \"hypothesis that cannot be excluded.\" As talk grows in the West, the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in East Germany, as people leave the country in near-record numbers. More than 100,000 East Germans are expected to resettle in West Germany this year, leaving a gaping hole in the Communist nation's work force. Little is likely to change in East Germany as long as the 77-year-old Honecker and his aging comrades stay in power. During a September 1987 visit to Bonn, Honecker called respect for Europe's present borders a basic condition of peace. \"Socialism and capitalism can't be any more united than fire and water,\" Honecker added on the issue of reunification. There are virtually no indications that Honecker's successors will be inclined to democratic reforms, let alone joining the capitalist West. The calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the Polish Solidarity movement, in the country that suffered some of the Nazis' most brutal savagery. \"After all, the abnormal situation of the German nation overshadows the whole of Polish-German relations,\" member of Parliament Adam Michnik wrote on Monday in the pro-Solidarity daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, which he edits. The renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly prophetic words of Reinhold Maier, a prominent West German state governor who later went on to head the centrist Free Democratic Party. \"Reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness. Tired and weak, indecisive people in West Germany are trying not to disturb her sleep,\" Maier predicted in 1955. \"The lioness will one day wake up, blink, snap her her tail and start to roar.\" Still, many in both East and West still agree with the 1967 quip by Nobel Prize-winning French author Francois Mauriac: \"I love Germany so much, I'm delighted that there are two of them.\""}

{"input": " America's 1988 drought captured attention everywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed through the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history.\n<highlight_start>The Associated Press went back to track<highlight_end> where the $3.9 billion went and found the money spread far beyond the drought.\nBy SCOTT McCARTNEY, and FRED BAYLES, Associated Press Writers : \n<highlight_start>The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for small farmers devastated<highlight_end> by a brutal dry spell, <highlight_start>became<highlight_end> much more _\n<highlight_start>an unexpected, election-year windfall for thousands of farmers<highlight_end> who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks.\nAn Associated Press study conducted over seven months found <highlight_start>the<highlight_end> drought relief <highlight_start>bill paid cash to farmers for<highlight_end> everything from hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to <highlight_start>heat-stressed radicchio in Massachusetts<highlight_end>, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.\n<highlight_start>Payments went<highlight_end> far <highlight_start>beyond the<highlight_end> initial <highlight_start>intent to save Midwestern grain growers<highlight_end> from bankruptcy, an effort _ supported by almost everyone _ that simply grew and grew and grew.\nAt each step, <highlight_start>the program was broadened<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>Congress<highlight_end> began with a bill to aid drought victims.\nThe lawmakers <highlight_start>added hail<highlight_end> to the relief package.\n<highlight_start>Then floods<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>Next<highlight_end> came \"<highlight_start>heat<highlight_end>,\" an addition from the Agriculture Department.\n<highlight_start>By the time checks were being written<highlight_end> at the county level, the AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils as <highlight_start>insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus<highlight_end>, even \"ineffective herbicide.\"\nNone of those conditions should have been ruled eligible, administrators in Washington say.\nNothing in federal procedures, however, requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for routine approval or checking.\nBy the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S. farmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states.\nThe taxpayers' tab ran to $3.9 billion.\n\"We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,\" said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had hail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the first time in 1988.\nLoose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major reasons for the government generosity, the AP found by examining federal records in 14 states through the Freedom of Information Act.\nThe politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief measure.\n\"Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to farmers,\" said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University.\n\"(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of agriculture.\"\nIn the end, <highlight_start>drought relief became a<highlight_end> one-time <highlight_start>bonus for<highlight_end> thousands of <highlight_start>farmers in parts of the country that<highlight_end> in 1988 <highlight_start>generally enjoyed good crops<highlight_end> at higher prices <highlight_start>and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including<highlight_end> parts of <highlight_start>California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey<highlight_end>.\nAlthough some producers appeared to have violated eligibility requirements _ exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for example _\ntheir requests for aid were approved anyway by local officials.\nMost farmers simply took advantage of a generous program.\nAs tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what was offered, they said.\n\"It was there, so I took it,\" said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.\nGovernment officials say they did the best they could with a rushed program.\nLoopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1 billion drought relief program.\n\"Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true,\" said Dan Shaw, deputy administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which administers payment programs for the Agriculture Department.\n\"What percentage, we don't know.\nBut that is part of the beast I guess that was created.\nWhenever you do this for the whole nation, there are some people that luck out.\"\nThe AP found some farmers who did better than just luck out.\nThose growers profited by \"triple-dipping\": reaping crop insurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting the same ground for a successful harvest _ all perfectly legal under the 1988 program.\nDisaster payments in several states also went to banks, corporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations designed to match benefits to small farmers.\nIn several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief because of the bill's $2 million cutoff on gross annual income collected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm.\nSanta Fe Pacific Co., the railroad giant with annual revenue of $3 billion, received a check through its energy division.\nThe American Cancer Society got a check, as did a unit of Texas A&amp;M\nUniversity and the mid-Atlantic headquarters in Baltimore of the Jesuit order.\nPryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N.J., a $9 million-a-year produce, garden and truck farming operation, collected $100,000 for losses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce because the local Agriculture Department official said he thought the $2 million ceiling applied to just the vegetable operation.\nWrong, say Washington officials _\nthe ceiling applies to revenue from all operations.\n<highlight_start>Despite<highlight_end> all <highlight_start>the<highlight_end> apparent <highlight_start>misapplications<highlight_end> of aid, <highlight_start>the program did provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by<highlight_end> severe <highlight_start>drought<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an estimated $1.1<highlight_end> billion to the drought, <highlight_start>but<highlight_end> direct federal <highlight_start>aid cut that by 36 percent, to $706 million<highlight_end>.\nIn Iowa the aid, calculated by the federal government at $335 million, went a long way, state agriculture secretary Dale Cochran said.\nWithout that money, \"it would have meant substantially more losses to Main Street,\" Cochran said.\n\"Drought legislation saved businesses from having to close their doors.\"\nTo examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought payments were matched county by county in a computer database.\nFrom those results, the AP selected 120 counties for further study.\nFarm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual farms' participation in the program, were requested for about 12,000 farms in those counties under the Freedom of Information Act.\nBecause much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties, reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific farmers, also available under the FOIA.\nOne such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000 acres near Levelland.\nGresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer.\nBecause of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected $248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop insurance.\nAnd he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with milo _ and made a good crop.\nAccording to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly $100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully.\n\"I'll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for me,\" Gresham said.\n\"You can't farm without the government.\nYou play their game.\"", "gold_summary": "An investigation revealed that the record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed as salvation for devastated small mid-western grain farmers, became an unexpected election-year windfall for thousands of unintended farmers.\nThe bill was broadened by Congress to include hail, then floods, next heat, and eventually, insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus.\nFarmers in non-drought areas such as California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland, New Jersey and Massachusetts benefited.\nNevertheless, the program did provide crucial assistance where needed, particularly in hard-hit North Dakota, where an estimated $1.1 million drought loss was cut by 36 percent to $706 million.", "highlights": [{"text": "The Associated Press went back to track", "score": 0.045}, {"text": "The

captured attention everywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed through the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history.   went back   where the $3.9 billion   the drought. By SCOTT McCARTNEY, and FRED BAYLES, Associated Press Writers :    record   for small   devastated by a brutal dry spell, became much more _ an unexpected,   windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature's normal quirks. An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the drought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from hail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in Massachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out bird seed in Colorado.   the initial  , an effort _ supported by almost everyone _ that simply grew and grew and grew. At each step, the program was broadened.   began with a bill to aid drought victims. The lawmakers  . Next came \"heat,\" an addition from the Agriculture Department. By the time checks were being written at the county level, the AP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal agriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even \"ineffective herbicide.\" None of those conditions should have been ruled eligible, administrators in Washington say. Nothing in federal procedures, however, requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for routine approval or checking. By the end of this October, about   to most of 506 eligible crops and just about any kind of weather peril in 49 states. The taxpayers' tab ran to $3.9 billion. \"We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,\" said Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who's had   23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the first time in 1988.   of them were the major reasons for the government generosity, the AP found by examining federal records in 14 states through the Freedom of Information Act. The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles in rushing through the nation's largest ever disaster relief measure. \"Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to farmers,\" said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University. \"(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of agriculture.\" In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in parts of the country that in 1988   and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey. Although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility requirements _ exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for example _ their requests for aid were approved anyway by local officials. Most farmers simply took advantage of a generous program. As tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what was offered, they said. \"It was there, so I took it,\" said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and corn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because hail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated farm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year. Government officials say they did the best they could with a rushed program. Loopholes were tightened in 1989's smaller $1 billion drought relief program. \"Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true,\" said Dan Shaw, deputy administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which administers payment programs for the Agriculture Department. \"What percentage, we don't know. But that is part of the beast I guess that was created. Whenever you do this for the whole nation, there are some people that luck out.\"   who did better than just luck out. Those growers profited by \"triple-dipping\":   _ all perfectly legal under the 1988 program. Disaster   in several states  , investment firms,   such as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations designed to match benefits to small farmers. In several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief because of the bill's $2 million cutoff on gross annual income collected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm. Santa Fe Pacific Co., the railroad giant with annual revenue of $3 billion, received a check through its energy division. The American Cancer Society got a check, as did a unit of Texas A&amp;M University and the mid-Atlantic headquarters in Baltimore of the Jesuit order. Pryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N.J., a $9 million-a-year produce, garden and truck farming operation, collected $100,000 for losses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce because the local Agriculture Department official said he thought the $2 million ceiling applied to just the vegetable operation. Wrong, say Washington officials _ the ceiling applies to revenue from all operations. Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did provide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought. In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an estimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut that by 36 percent, to $706 million. In Iowa the aid, calculated by the federal government at $335 million, went a long way, state agriculture secretary Dale Cochran said. Without that money, \"it would have meant substantially more losses to Main Street,\" Cochran said. \"Drought legislation saved businesses from having to close their doors.\" To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts in 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought payments were matched county by county in a computer database. From those results, the AP selected 120 counties for further study. Farm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual farms' participation in the program, were requested for about 12,000 farms in those counties under the Freedom of Information Act. Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties, reporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific farmers, also available under the FOIA. One such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000 acres near Levelland. Gresham readily offers that he and his son operate their farms under five different names precisely because of federal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000 per farmer. Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected $248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop insurance. And he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with milo _ and made a good crop. According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly $100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully. \"I'll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for me,\" Gresham said. \"You can't farm without the government. You play their game.\""}

The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed,  , the first of 20 planned across the Soviet Union.   was so intense   until midnight,  . \"I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before me,\" said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant. \"And it was only 10 rubles for all this,\" she said. \"I'm taking it back for the girls at the factory to try.\"   and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _   a starting   staffer or  , but   that have sprung up recently. The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currency is worth on the black market. Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund, which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of McDonald's Canada, said from Toronto. The restaurant, built by the company   a joint venture with   that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates. The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest, company officials said. Besides its restaurants in the United States, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan, the officials said.   such alien concepts as   fast,  . Normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard. Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales. One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink.  . Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic letters, approximating \"gamburger.\" They tried them one-handed. They picked their sandwiches apart to examine the contents. One young woman finally squashed her \"Beeg Mak\" to fit her lips around it. \"It tasted great!\" a 14-year-old boy said. \"It's a lot different from a stolovaya,\" he continued with a smile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage. Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-awaited grand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly for McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army fulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos. Publicity-conscious managers had the staff shout \"Good morning, America!\" in English and Russian, for an American TV network. McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind the deal, said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first five hours of operation. The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer in hopes of preventing burger-scalping.   and even potato storage yard,  . One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importing wooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because \"when they went to build crates, they found there was no wood, and no nails. They found you need a permit to buy nails.\""}

{"input": " U.S. tour operators are planning to send a record 4,000 or more travelers to Antarctica, prompting calls for strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife and the very fate of the frozen continent.\n\"<highlight_start>The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than tripled in the past five years,\" said Bruce Manheim, a Washington activist of the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing controls inadequate<highlight_end>.\nAntarctica has become a \"hot\" travel destination for the 1990s, beckoning older Americans seeking more adventure than Europe and hoping to see a fragile frontierland visited by only a privileged few in their youth.\nThey are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry, an estimated $1.3 billion-a-year phenomenon.\nAbout 800 American tourists traveled to Antarctica in 1988, 3,000 in 1989, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the December-February summer season.\nManheim says it could reach 5,000.\n\"There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary visits to remote places in the world,\" said Manheim.\nHe filed an appeal Tuesday with the government urging more regulation.\n\"We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to Antarctica, we just think tourism is something that has to be regulated carefully,\" he said.\nConcern began mounting after the January 1989 grounding of the Argentine naval ship Bahia Paraiso in which an estimated 175,000 gallons leaked into marine habitats, killing seals, penguins and other marine life.\nThe vessel remains at the site off Palmer Station with some oil in its tanks.\nParticularly worrisome to critics are the plans of Ocean Cruise Lines of Fort Lauderdale to send the largest cruise ship in years to Antarctica, the 460-passenger Ocean Princess.\nRates begin at $3,895 per person for a double-occupancy cabin on its three wine-and-caviar cruises, which are selling briskly.\nThe first round trip from Buenos Aires, Argentina, begins Dec. 22.\n<highlight_start>Manheim's appeal is urging<highlight_end> the government to place <highlight_start>strict controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of cruise ship visits to breeding grounds<highlight_end>.\nHe said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same wildlife sites, disrupting the breeding of seals, penguins and other birds.\n\"A year after Antarctica's most significant environmental disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar catastrophes,\" said Manheim.\n<highlight_start>The U.S. government responds that effective regulations are already in place<highlight_end>.\n\"We have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with the explosion of Antarctica tourism,\" said Jack Talmadge of <highlight_start>the National Science Foundation<highlight_end>, which <highlight_start>regulates U.S. activities in Antarctica<highlight_end>.\nTalmadge said the NSF has issued tourist regulations, established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and taken steps to limit visits to U.S. research stations.\nHe said the tour operators are also cooperating with the NSF to minimize the impact of tourism, including giving advance notice of ship visits.\nAlthough 16 nations fly flags in Antactica and seven claim slices of it, no nation holds title to the continent, which is larger than the United States and Mexico combined.\nMilitary flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists have been frequent modes of travel to Antarctica since the first tourists visited in 1958.\nNow, the Chilean government has opened a spartan hotel at its Teniente Marsh Station on King George island, and LanChile airlines began commercial flights to that Antarctic stop last year.\nAustralian entrepreneurs have proposed a five-story hotel, airstrip and hovercraft dock.\nThe Canada-based Adventure Network currently flies tourists to one South Pole station.\nBut <highlight_start>the bulk of the tourists are Americans<highlight_end> brought in by U.S.-based operators.\n<highlight_start>Conservationists say the United States should therefore take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy<highlight_end>.\n\"Antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the United States, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international level,\" said Manheim.\nOperators of the Ocean Cruise Lines said there is no cause for alarm.\n\"The tourist visiting Antarctica is a determined environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and I can assure you that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal,\" said Lars Eric Lindblad, an Antarctic travel pioneer who will lecture aboard the Ocean Princess.\nJames Barnes, with Friends of the Earth in Washington, concludes that the travelers may leave their footprints, but they often return home more committed

They are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry, an estimated $1.3 billion-a-year phenomenon. About 800 American tourists traveled to Antarctica in 1988, 3,000 in 1989, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the December-February summer season.

brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist Party, but he was fired in 1987 after showing little reverance for party hierarchy.\nYeltsin, however, made his rift with Gorbachev work for him.\nThe popular and outspoken Yeltsin had lost the second round of voting on Saturday by just 28 votes.\nHe lost the first round Friday with 497 ballots to 473 for Krasnodar regional Communist Party chief Ivan Polozkov.\nHe was nominated again Monday and faced Vlasov, who had Gorbachev's support, and Valentin Tsoy, a little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East, who received 11 votes.\nAfter his election, Yeltsin walked through the Kremlin grounds with reporters and well-wishers.\nAfter passing through the Spassky Gate, he was joined by more supporters.\n\"Thank you!\nThank you for our future!\"\none man shouted.\nYeltsin mounted the steps of an embankment below the Kremlin wall for an impromptu speech to supporters who rushed across the cobblestone street.\nTo shouts of \"victory!\"\nYeltsin pledged to work for a \"renewed Russia.\"\nThe crowd pledged support.\n\"We're prepared to go together with him into tough times.\nEveryone says that,\" one crowd member, Nadezda Matveyeva said.\nDuring his campaign, Yeltsin called on the Congress to reject the Kremlin's new program for gradually transforming the country's crippled, centrally planned economy to a partial market economy.\n\"The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its defense,\" he said.\nThe reform program, which would triple the price of bread on July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting Jan. 1, caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city authorities to bar sales to non-residents of the capital.\nGorbachev, who left Moscow today for a Washington summit, went on national television Sunday night to try to calm fears.\nBut anxiety is high and the list of items being rationed is on the rise.\nYeltsin has broadly outlined a plan that would more rapidly seek a transition to a market-based economy, giving more freedom to enterprises and entrepreneurs.\nLawmakers said Monday they believed Yeltsin's offer of a coalition government in the republic bolstered his chances to win today's round.\nDiscontent over the government's economic program also boosted Yeltsin's campaign, said one of his backers, lawmaker Leonid Gurevich of Murmansk.\nSome economists have estimated that up to 40 million people could lose their jobs as a result of the central government's reforms, expected to drive many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy.\nUnder the three-step reform plan, to be implemented through 1995, 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public sector, and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices.", "gold_summary": "Radical

It is home to one-half the country's 285 million people and includes Moscow. As the president of Russia, Yeltsin will have a highly visible platform from which to wage his campaign for more radical reforms than those pursued so far by Gorbachev. The victory marks an amazing comeback for Yeltsin. Less than three years ago, he was reviled in the Soviet press, attacked by party officials, rebuffed by his former mentor, Gorbachev, and considered finished politically. Gorbachev had brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist Party, but he was fired in 1987 after showing little reverance for party hierarchy. Yeltsin, however, made his rift with Gorbachev work for him. The popular and outspoken Yeltsin had lost the second round of voting on Saturday by just 28 votes. He lost the first round Friday with 497 ballots to 473 for Krasnodar regional Communist Party chief Ivan Polozkov. He was nominated again Monday and faced Vlasov, who had Gorbachev's support, and Valentin Tsoy, a little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East, who received 11 votes. After his election, Yeltsin walked through the Kremlin grounds with reporters and well-wishers. After passing through the Spassky Gate, he was joined by more supporters. \"Thank you! Thank you for our future!\" one man shouted. Yeltsin mounted the steps of an embankment below the Kremlin wall for an impromptu speech to supporters who rushed across the cobblestone street. To shouts of \"victory!\" Yeltsin pledged to work for a \"renewed Russia.\" The crowd pledged support. \"We're prepared to go together with him into tough times. Everyone says that,\" one crowd member, Nadezda Matveyeva said. During his campaign, Yeltsin called on the Congress to reject the Kremlin's new program for gradually transforming the country's crippled, centrally planned economy to a partial market economy. \"The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its defense,\" he said. The reform program, which would triple the price of bread on July 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting Jan. 1, caused panic buying that prompted Moscow city authorities to bar sales to non-residents of the capital. Gorbachev, who left Moscow today for a Washington summit, went on national television Sunday night to try to calm fears. But anxiety is high and the list of items being rationed is on the rise. Yeltsin has broadly outlined a plan that would more rapidly seek a transition to a market-based economy, giving more freedom to enterprises and entrepreneurs. Lawmakers said Monday they believed Yeltsin's offer of a coalition government in the republic bolstered his chances to win today's round. Discontent over the government's economic program also boosted Yeltsin's campaign, said one of his backers, lawmaker Leonid Gurevich of Murmansk. Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people could lose their jobs as a result of the central government's reforms, expected to drive many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy. Under the three-step reform plan, to be implemented through 1995, 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public sector, and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices."}

has focused on improving the state's education system<highlight_end>, counters by <highlight_start>calling himself the candidate of change<highlight_end>.\n\"Frankly, if you look at what I proposed, compared with the others, it represents more change,\" he said.\n\"Ten years is an asset, not a liability.\"\nClinton <highlight_start>lost<highlight_end> his first re-election bid <highlight_start>in 1980<highlight_end> to Republican Frank White, but <highlight_start>won again in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when the<highlight_end> gubernatorial <highlight_start>term was changed to four years<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>He has all but promised not to run for the White House in 1992 if re-elected this year<highlight_end>.\nHis showing in this year's primary, largely in line with pre-election polls, was the first time since his political comeback in 1982 that Clinton got less than 60 percent of the primary vote.\n\"I'm sure the governor would like to have made a better showing, but when you're in office 10 years you have a lot of friends and a lot of enemies,\" said Bill Paschall, a Little Rock political consultant.\n\"I don't think it's a death blow that he made 55 (percent), but it shows him he has to work harder.\"\nWhile the biggest complaint against Clinton appears to be that he has been in office too long, the governor also has been accused of being more interested in his national ambitions than state concerns.\nClinton's recent troubles with the legislature also have been a sticking point.\nTwice in 1989 he failed to win legislative approval for proposals to increase taxes.\nNelson, who hopes to paint Clinton as a tax-and-spend Democrat, said the primary election results show the governor is on the ropes.\n\"I'd say against an unknown who never held an office, I think that was low.\nIt probably did make some bells go off in his head,\" Nelson said.\nClinton said he would have done better if a large number of traditional Democrats hadn't crossed over to the GOP primary to vote against Robinson.\n\"We did poorly in areas where I did not campaign; where my supporters, in spite of my best interest, believed the polls and didn't work; and where we did a poor job of telling the people what I had done that affected their lives; and where people knew there was an alternative but didn't know much about what the alternative was,\" Clinton said.\nBetsey Wright, Clinton's former chief of staff, said the governor's supporters were complacent.\n\"Bill Clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people find it difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight energies,\" she said of the primary.", "gold_summary": "Governor Bill Clinton won his sixth straight primary election by 55%, a drop from previous

years of experience who's doing a good job.\"\nClinton has focused on improving Arkansas' educational system and calls himself the candidate of change.\nHe was elected first in 1978 but lost in 1980.\nHe won again in '82, '84, and '86, when the term was increased to four years.\nHe has implied that if he is elected this year, he will not run for president in 1992.", "highlights": [{"text":

Betsey Wright, Clinton's former chief of staff, said the governor's supporters were complacent. \"Bill Clinton is always perceived as being so strong that people find it difficult to believe in calls for such cohesion and tight energies,\" she said of the primary."}

The sun rises unusually early during summer in the extreme northern latitudes where Finland is located. The sun comes up unusually late during winter. Ten months ago, Joensuu hired an \"eclipse secretary\" to handle arrangements for the expected influx of visitors. But that official, Marjut Cadia, said she had underestimated the interest in the event. \"We completely sold out the 10,000 special eyeglasses we made for this event, and our extra stock is finished too,\" she said in a television interview Saturday. During the past week,   been full of information about solar eclipses, as well as  . Some eclipse viewers won't have to worry about the clouds, because they will be above them.  , the national airline,  , and private companies with small planes will provide more.   and southeast Finland,  . Scientists will conduct several experiments during the eclipse, including gravity test measurements of the radius of the sun. However, scientific interest in this eclipse has been less than in longer eclipses, such as the seven-minute eclipse seen from northern Kenya on June 30, 1973. Seppo Linnaluoto of the Ursa Astronomical Association said the best place for observations of this eclipse will be the northeast Soviet Union. "}

percent of the drilling has been completed by giant, Japanese-built boring machines working from Calais and Folkstone, England.\nTuesday's linkup in the service tunnel is described by the French as a \"mouse ole\" - a bore only two inches in diameter.\nPresident Francois Mitterrand and Mrs. Thatcher are expected to meet each other in the tunnel Jan. 26, after the digging for much of the tunnel is finished.\nThe first coupling of the two rail tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.\nEurotunnel PLC, the world's largest engineering project, announced Oct. 8 that it had reached an agreement with its

Times<highlight_end>.\nMeanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the <highlight_start>Serious Fraud Office<highlight_end>, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell.\nThis is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust, <highlight_start>Yakosa Finanzierungs<highlight_end>, and the Maxwell family.\nThe FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately <highlight_start>involved<highlight_end> in the purchase of 9m shares by <highlight_start>Yakosa and<highlight_end> a further 16m shares by <highlight_start>Servex, another Swiss Trust<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>The MCC purchases<highlight_end> by Yakosa and Servex <highlight_start>are the object of an investigation by the SFO<highlight_end> into an alleged <highlight_start>illegal scheme to support the MCC share price<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>The SFO is also investigating whether<highlight_end> Mr Robert <highlight_start>Maxwell or<highlight_end> Mr <highlight_start>Kevin<highlight_end> Maxwell <highlight_start>breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases<highlight_end> of the shares by the Swiss trusts.\nIf either had a financial interest in the Swiss trusts, the purchases should have been disclosed under company law, because they were both directors of MCC.\nThe documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the <highlight_start>two<highlight_end> Swiss <highlight_start>trusts<highlight_end> so that they could pay for the MCC shares.\n<highlight_start>Goldman Sachs<highlight_end>, <highlight_start>the US investment bank<highlight_end>,

has maintained since <highlight_start>Robert Maxwell's death<highlight_end> in November on the subject of his relationship with the Maxwell family.\nHe said MCC share purchases had been 'going on for some time' through Yakosa.\nHe denied that the shares were bought for Yakosa's 'own account'.\nHe said the shares were bought for other 'foundations' and then 'held for a certain time.'\nHe also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by the Maxwell Foundation,' he said.\nMr Rechsteiner refused to

closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex.\nOn May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company.\nThe fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury'.\nTwo other faxes sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the transaction, the sale of the 25m shares.\nThe Swiss trusts bought the shares, using Goldman as broker, from two Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme) and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme).\nEach pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds 27.47m in total.\nAt 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds.\nAs a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each pension fund what it was owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr Maxwell described as 'nominee' for the two pension funds.\nIn other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be sent by Goldman back to BIT.\nIn the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer in its account at Barclays.\nGoldman then levied its commission and expenses on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest account.\nScots bank

{"input": " If Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico's next president, had any doubts about the difficulties of reforming Mexico's governing party and the country's corrupt judicial and legal system, <highlight_start>the assassination last week<highlight_end> of <highlight_start>Mr Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu<highlight_end>, <highlight_start>the party's number two official<highlight_end>, will probably have removed them.\n<highlight_start>Mr Ruiz Massieu's killing was allegedly ordered by Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a federal deputy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), and Mr Abraham Rubio Canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the Gulf drug cartel in the state of Tamaulipas.<highlight_end>\nThe two allegedly hired the gunman, and other accomplices, according to testimony from one man who has confessed to his role in the killing.\nThis alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a man with links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by Mr Zedillo to reform his party and the country's criminal justice system will be met with fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these changes.\nAccording to testimony from the alleged accomplices to the assassination, the conspirators drew up a list of reform-minded politicians with plans to kill all of them.\nSince Mr Ruiz Massieu's assassination, there has been renewed speculation that <highlight_start>political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the killing six months ago of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's reform-minded presidential candidate<highlight_end>, even though no evidence has emerged to indicate this is the case.\nMr Carlos Fuentes, the novelist, asked yesterday in a newspaper article entitled 'Who is next?' whether Mexico, like Colombia, was facing a period of sustained political violence orchestrated by drug barons.\nOther columnists have insinuated that more groups than currently revealed might be involved in Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder.\nMr Munoz Rocha has promised to hand himself in if his safety is guaranteed, according to a statement by Mexico's Congress.\nTwo newspapers reported yesterday that <highlight_start>Mr Munoz Rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but put the responsibility on Mr Rubio Canales<highlight_end>, who reportedly blames Mr Ruiz Massieu for his conviction for fraud in 1992, and the prison sentence he is currently serving.\nMr Munoz Rocha said he participated in the assassination 'because I was angry that I had not been supported in my political aspirations'.\nThe ruling party has denied that the crime reflects an internal battle between ideological factions in the PRI.\nMr Ignacio Pichardo, the president of the party, declared on Monday that Mr Munoz Rocha 'never had intellectual interests, never raised issues of political theory, and was never associated with making ideological pronouncements.'\nMr Pichardo insisted that the reform of the PRI would go ahead.\nAs if to underline this pledge, Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the head of the PRI group in the Chamber of Deputies and a reformist, was appointed to replace Mr Ruiz Massieu as the party's secretary-general.\nGovernment officials have suggested the Gulf drug cartel may have deliberately involved Mr Munoz Rocha in the assassination to maximise the political impact of the crime.\nThe motives of drug traffickers are uncertain.\nOne view is they believed the assassination would weaken Mr Ruiz Massieu's brother, Mario, who is the deputy attorney general in charge of drug enforcement.\nIf this was the motivation, the plan may have backfired.\nMr Ruiz Massieu has taken charge of the investigation into his brother's death, and search for drug cartel members appears to have intensified.\nAnother view is the cartel was seeking revenge.\nMr Mario Ruiz Massieu recently had arrested Raul Valladares, top lieutenant in the Gulf Cartel and son-in-law of Mr Rubio Canales, the man in the Acapulco jail accused of jointly plotting the assassination.", "gold_summary": "Last week the number two official in Mexico's ruling

Gates said.\n\"Utter, complete stupidity.\"\nIn reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used \"in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . .\nall through the '60s, all through the '70s,\" Gates said.\nHe smiled.\n\"You didn't hear any Republicans complain then, did you?\"\nWhile Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy about \"chokeholds\" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening situations as a result of fierce public pressure -- he argues that \"come-along\" techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest nonviolent demonstrators.\n His officers, he added, are as well-trained in the use of these holds as any in the country.\nOn a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds.\n Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: \"Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.\"\n Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether \"reasonable force\" included opening fire with her handgun.\n Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt.\nFred Nichols, the academy's expert on the use of force.\nThe least forceful tactic is a simple request -- \"Would you do this?\"\nPain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton.\n Among the most simple \"come-along\" compliance techniques are twist- and wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said.\nAnother trick of the trade: the \"mastoid lift,\" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the neck.\nDemonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly.\n But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and \"go limp\" when asked to move, others link arms.\nThey become \"human worm-balls\" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance techniques ineffective, officers say.\nTrying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.\n So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a \"police control device\" -- consisting of two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon.\n To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a \"trap-and-wrap\" maneuver.\nThe gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly.\n Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa.\nProtesters are given every chance to move on their own.\nPolice actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.\nThen \"they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain.\nIt's a pain control technique,\" he said.\n\"It's going to hurt.\nThat's what pain-compliance means.\"\n But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting nerve damage.\nAs a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.\n Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.\n \"The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,\" Nichols said.\n\"With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark.\nIt's kind of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking.\nYou say, something's wrong here.\"\nIn the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt.\nPatrick E. McKinley of LAPD's Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary Communist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against everything from apartheid to animal rights.\nOperation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.\n \"Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion,\" he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.\n Nichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle relaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue spokeswoman called \"100% incorrect.\"\n In either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley.\n\"I'm no doctor.\nBut pain has a purpose.\nIt's telling you to stop doing what you're doing.\nIf you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible.\"\nIn fact, <highlight_start>injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta<highlight_end>.\nAs Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil disobedience at clinics around the country, <highlight_start>the allegations of police brutality<highlight_end> increased: \n * <highlight_start>In San Diego<highlight_end>, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: \"Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em.\"\n * In <highlight_start>Pittsburgh<highlight_end>, women claimed they were sexually molested by officers.\n * In <highlight_start>West Hartford, Conn.<highlight_end>, officers removed their badges and name tags -- purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, or with \"crotch carries\" in which a night stick is stuck between the protester's legs.\nA priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting pain: \"The demonic element entered in here.\"\n A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: \"By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . .\n'\nJesus!\nJesus!'\n\"\nIn demonstrations in those cities and others, including <highlight_start>Boston<highlight_end>, Atlanta <highlight_start>and Denver<highlight_end>, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of \"curbside justice.\"\n Implicit in the protesters' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed by kindred spirits.\n \"It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent,\" said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration.\n\"Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life.\nI've never been roughed up like that before.\nMaybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.\"\n Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police.\nRather, leaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt they had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file complaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\nA group called Pro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed \"real atrocities\" by the LAPD.\nBut others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint.\nFor example, feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she believes police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings and acting only after demonstrators failed to comply.\n \"I can't have much sympathy for them,\" she said of the anti-abortion \"rescuers,\" as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice \"clinic defenders\" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton.\n\"The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous.\nWhat they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights.\"\nAt demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: \"L.A. blue, we're with you.\"\n Chief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found support.\n\"I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the Christians to the lions,\" he said.\nIn fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.\n Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for letting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters' fight to restrain what he calls \"the torture police.\"\nHe also has charged that his media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex issue.\n William B. Allen, a controversial Ronald Reagan appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, has similar views: \"We like to value tolerance.\nBut you never know how tolerant you are until you're challenged on something you care about.\nThis issue has touched some very raw nerves, and we find we're not as tolerant as we pretend to be.\"\n At a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in September, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his officers.\n \"I have never heard of training that consists of using stretchers for one class of prisoner and come-along holds for others based on the motivation of a crime,\" he said.\n\"All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest.\nI don't want them concerned with abortions, nuclear freezes, saving the whales or whatever.\"\n Even before the commission met, conservative lawmakers were joining Sen. Armstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing legislation to restrain them.\n Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) read into the Congressional Record a column by William F. Buckley Jr. comparing the West Hartford demonstrations to civil rights demonstrations in Alabama three decades ago: \"It is hard to believe that Bull Connor, directing white redneck policemen, caused more brutality in the treatment of blacks than was caused by the police of West Hartford in their treatment of members of Operation Rescue.\"\n An amendment introduced by conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate, and tagged onto a HUD bill later signed by the President, states that no Community Planning and Development grants may be paid \"to any municipality that fails to adopt and enforce a policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law enforcement agencies within the jurisdiction of said municipality against any individuals engaged in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations.\"\n Los Angeles received almost $56 million in such grants in fiscal year 1989.\n\"This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do,\" said Gates.\n\"Now we've got Republicans doing it.\"\n The Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates pointed out.\nBut if this \"horrendous\" new measure has its intended effect, eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe take over any facility they choose, he said.\n Carol Sobel, staff attorney for the Los Angeles Chapter of the ACLU, shares Gates' assessment that the government acted in this case because conservative lawmakers were sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause.\nBut, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often \"barbaric,\" and she supports restraints on the police.\n Sobel was \"amused\" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives.\n Still, she believes the new measure will help assure \"that the cost of demonstrating in this town doesn't escalate.\nI just hope conservatives remember that it includes everyone.\"\n Jim Cady in the Times Editorial Library assisted in the research for this article.\n * NEW USE FOR OLD

At one point, two officers twist a woman's arm till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched in agony. In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along. His arm, contorted behind his back, finally snaps.   \" Police departments nationwide say it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate. But   a euphemism for  .  Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago. This time, however, the outcry -- including the   police in action -- comes from   with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.  As a result, traditional political alliances have been turned topsy-turvy. Suddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of \"police state\" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals.  In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican senator, decried pain-compliance as \"something we expect to hear about in Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America.\"  Other conservative lawmakers have echoed his concerns, and on  , with little media attention,  Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.  Caught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are howling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than $50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them.  \"I think it's utter stupidity,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said. \"Utter, complete stupidity.\" In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used \"in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . . all through the '60s, all through the '70s,\" Gates said. He smiled. \"You didn't hear any Republicans complain then, did you?\" While Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy about \"chokeholds\" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening situations as a result of fierce public pressure -- he argues that \"come-along\" techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest nonviolent demonstrators.  His officers, he added, are as well-trained in the use of these holds as any in the country. On a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds.  Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: \"Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.\"  Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether \"reasonable force\" included opening fire with her handgun.  Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt. Fred Nichols, the academy's expert on the use of force. The least forceful tactic is a simple request -- \"Would you do this?\" Pain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton.  Among the most simple \"come-along\" compliance techniques are twist- and wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said. Another trick of the trade: the \"mastoid lift,\" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the neck. Demonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly.  But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and \"go limp\" when asked to move, others link arms. They become \"human worm-balls\" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance techniques ineffective, officers say. Trying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.  So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a \"police control device\" -- consisting of two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon.  To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a \"trap-and-wrap\" maneuver. The gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly.  Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa. Protesters are given every chance to move on their own. Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said. Then \"they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain. It's a pain control technique,\" he said. \"It's going to hurt. That's what pain-compliance means.\"  But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting nerve damage. As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.  Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.  \"The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,\" Nichols said. \"With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark. It's kind of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking. You say, something's wrong here.\" In the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt. Patrick E. McKinley of LAPD's Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary Communist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against everything from apartheid to animal rights. Operation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.  \"Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion,\" he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.  Nichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle relaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue spokeswoman called \"100% incorrect.\"  In either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley. \"I'm no doctor. But pain has a purpose. It's telling you to stop doing what you're doing. If you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible.\" In fact,  . As Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil disobedience at clinics around the country,   increased:   *  , an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: \"Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em.\"  * In  , women claimed they were sexually molested by officers.  * In  , officers removed their badges and name tags -- purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, or with \"crotch carries\" in which a night stick is stuck between the protester's legs. A priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting pain: \"The demonic element entered in here.\"  A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: \"By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . . ' Jesus! Jesus!' \" In demonstrations in those cities and others, including  , Atlanta  , protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of \"curbside justice.\"  Implicit in the protesters' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed by kindred spirits.  \"It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent,\" said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration. \"Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life. I've never been roughed up like that before. Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.\"  Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police. Rather, leaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt they had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file complaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A group called Pro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed \"real atrocities\" by the LAPD. But others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint. For example, feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she believes police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings and acting only after demonstrators failed to comply.  \"I can't have much sympathy for them,\" she said of the anti-abortion \"rescuers,\" as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice \"clinic defenders\" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton. \"The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous. What they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights.\" At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: \"L.A. blue, we're with you.\"  Chief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found support. \"I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the Christians to the lions,\" he said. In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.  Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for letting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters' fight to restrain what he calls \"the torture police.\" He also has charged that his media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex issue.  William B. Allen, a controversial Ronald Reagan appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, has similar views: \"We like to value tolerance. But you never know how tolerant you are until you're challenged on something you care about. This issue has touched some very raw nerves, and we find we're not as tolerant as we pretend to be.\"  At a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in September, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his officers.  \"I have never heard of training that consists of using stretchers for one class of prisoner and come-along holds for others based on the motivation of a crime,\" he said. \"All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest. I don't want them concerned with abortions, nuclear freezes, saving the whales or whatever.\"  Even before the commission met, conservative lawmakers were joining Sen. Armstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing legislation to restrain them.  Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) read into the Congressional Record a column by William F. Buckley Jr. comparing the West Hartford demonstrations to civil rights demonstrations in Alabama three decades ago: \"It is hard to believe that Bull Connor, directing white redneck policemen, caused more brutality in the treatment of blacks than was caused by the police of West Hartford in their treatment of members of Operation Rescue.\"  An amendment introduced by conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate, and tagged onto a HUD bill later signed by the President, states that no Community Planning and Development grants may be paid \"to any municipality that fails to adopt and enforce a policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law enforcement agencies within the jurisdiction of said municipality against any individuals engaged in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations.\"  Los Angeles received almost $56 million in such grants in fiscal year 1989. \"This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do,\" said Gates. \"Now we've got Republicans doing it.\"  The Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates pointed out. But if this \"horrendous\" new measure has its intended effect, eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe take over any facility they choose, he said.  Carol Sobel, staff attorney for the Los Angeles Chapter of the ACLU, shares Gates' assessment that the government acted in this case because conservative lawmakers were sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause. But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often \"barbaric,\" and she supports restraints on the police.  Sobel was \"amused\" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives.  Still, she believes the new measure will help assure \"that the cost of demonstrating in this town doesn't escalate. I just hope conservatives remember that it includes everyone.\"  Jim Cady in the Times Editorial Library assisted in the research for this article.  * NEW USE FOR OLD TOOL An ancient Asian farm tool has become a cutting edge weapon for many police officers in Southern California.

Gates<highlight_end> said.\n\"Utter, complete stupidity.\"\nIn reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used \"in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . .\nall through the '60s, all through the '70s,\" Gates said.\nHe smiled.\n\"You didn't hear any Republicans complain then, did you?\"\nWhile Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy about \"chokeholds\" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening situations as a result of fierce public pressure -- <highlight_start>he argues that \"come-along\" techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest nonviolent demonstrators.\n His officers, he added, are<highlight_end> as well-<highlight_start>trained in the use of these holds<highlight_end> as any in the country.\nOn a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds.\n Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: \"Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.\"\n Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether \"reasonable force\" included opening fire with her handgun.\n Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt.\nFred Nichols, the academy's expert on the use of force.\nThe least forceful tactic is a simple request -- \"Would you do this?\"\nPain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton.\n Among the most simple \"come-along\" compliance techniques are twist- and wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said.\nAnother trick of the trade: the \"mastoid lift,\" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the neck.\nDemonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly.\n But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and \"go limp\" when asked to move, others link arms.\nThey become \"human worm-balls\" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance techniques ineffective, officers say.\nTrying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.\n So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a \"police control device\" -- consisting of two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon.\n To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a \"trap-and-wrap\" maneuver.\nThe gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly.\n Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa.\nProtesters are given every chance to move on their own.\nPolice actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.\nThen \"they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain.\nIt's a pain control technique,\" he said.\n\"It's going to hurt.\nThat's what pain-compliance means.\"\n But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting nerve damage.\nAs a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.\n Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.\n \"The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,\" Nichols said.\n\"With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark.\nIt's kind of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking.\nYou say, something's wrong here.\"\nIn the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt.\nPatrick E. McKinley of LAPD's Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary Communist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against everything from apartheid to animal rights.\nOperation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.\n \"Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion,\" he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.\n Nichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle relaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue spokeswoman called \"100% incorrect.\"\n In either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley.\n\"I'm no doctor.\nBut pain has a purpose.\nIt's telling you to stop doing what you're doing.\nIf you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible.\"\nIn fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta.\nAs Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil disobedience at clinics around the country, the allegations of police brutality increased: \n * In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: \"Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em.\"\n * In Pittsburgh, women claimed they were sexually molested by officers.\n * In West Hartford, Conn., officers removed their badges and name tags -- purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, or with \"crotch carries\" in which a night stick is stuck between the protester's legs.\nA priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting pain: \"The demonic element entered in here.\"\n A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: \"By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . .\n'\nJesus!\nJesus!'\n\"\nIn demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of \"curbside justice.\"\n Implicit in the protesters' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed by kindred spirits.\n \"It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent,\" said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration.\n\"Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life.\nI've never been roughed up like that before.\nMaybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.\"\n Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police.\nRather, leaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt they had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file complaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\nA group called Pro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed \"real atrocities\" by the LAPD.\nBut others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint.\nFor example, feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she believes police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings and acting only after demonstrators failed to comply.\n \"I can't have much sympathy for them,\" she said of the anti-abortion \"rescuers,\" as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice \"clinic defenders\" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton.\n\"The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous.\nWhat they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights.\"\nAt demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: \"L.A. blue, we're with you.\"\n Chief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found support.\n\"I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the Christians to the lions,\" he said.\nIn fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.\n Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for letting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters' fight to restrain what he calls \"the torture police.\"\nHe also has charged that his media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex issue.\n William B.

Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago Police Chief Daryl F. Gates he argues that \"come-along\" techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest nonviolent demonstrators.  His officers, he added, are trained in the use of these holds But if this \"horrendous\" new measure has its intended effect, eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe take over any facility they choose, he said.", "unhighlights_concatenation": ". At one point, two officers twist a woman's arm till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched in agony. In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along.  \" Police departments nationwide say it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate.  . This time, however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.  As a result, traditional political alliances have been turned topsy-turvy. Suddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of \"police state\" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals.  In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican senator, decried pain-compliance as \"something we expect to hear about in Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America.\"  Other conservative lawmakers have echoed his concerns, and on Nov. 15, with little media attention, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police use excessive force. Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.  Caught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are howling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than $50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them.  \"I think it's utter stupidity,\" Los Angeles   said. \"Utter, complete stupidity.\" In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used \"in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . . all through the '60s, all through the '70s,\" Gates said. He smiled. \"You didn't hear any Republicans complain then, did you?\" While Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy about \"chokeholds\" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening situations as a result of fierce public pressure --   as well-  as any in the country. On a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds.  Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: \"Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.\"  Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether \"reasonable force\" included opening fire with her handgun.  Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt. Fred Nichols, the academy's expert on the use of force. The least forceful tactic is a simple request -- \"Would you do this?\" Pain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton.  Among the most simple \"come-along\" compliance techniques are twist- and wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said. Another trick of the trade: the \"mastoid lift,\" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the neck. Demonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly.  But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and \"go limp\" when asked to move, others link arms. They become \"human worm-balls\" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance techniques ineffective, officers say. Trying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.  So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a \"police control device\" -- consisting of two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon.  To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a \"trap-and-wrap\" maneuver. The gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly.  Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa. Protesters are given every chance to move on their own. Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said. Then \"they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain. It's a pain control technique,\" he said. \"It's going to hurt. That's what pain-compliance means.\"  But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting nerve damage. As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.  Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.  \"The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,\" Nichols said. \"With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark. It's kind of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking. You say, something's wrong here.\" In the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt. Patrick E. McKinley of LAPD's Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary Communist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against everything from apartheid to animal rights. Operation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.  \"Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion,\" he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.  Nichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle relaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue spokeswoman called \"100% incorrect.\"  In either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley. \"I'm no doctor. But pain has a purpose. It's telling you to stop doing what you're doing. If you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible.\" In fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta. As Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil disobedience at clinics around the country, the allegations of police brutality increased:   * In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: \"Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em.\"  * In Pittsburgh, women claimed they were sexually molested by officers.  * In West Hartford, Conn., officers removed their badges and name tags -- purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, or with \"crotch carries\" in which a night stick is stuck between the protester's legs. A priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting pain: \"The demonic element entered in here.\"  A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: \"By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . . ' Jesus! Jesus!' \" In demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of \"curbside justice.\"  Implicit in the protesters' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed by kindred spirits.  \"It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent,\" said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration. \"Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life. I've never been roughed up like that before. Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.\"  Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police. Rather, leaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt they had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file complaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A group called Pro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed \"real atrocities\" by the LAPD. But others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint. For example, feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she believes police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings and acting only after demonstrators failed to comply.  \"I can't have much sympathy for them,\" she said of the anti-abortion \"rescuers,\" as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice \"clinic defenders\" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton. \"The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous. What they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights.\" At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: \"L.A. blue, we're with you.\"  Chief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found support. \"I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the Christians to the lions,\" he said. In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force.  Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for letting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters' fight to restrain what he calls \"the torture police.\" He also has charged that his media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex issue.  William B. Allen, a controversial Ronald Reagan appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, has similar views: \"We like to value tolerance. But you never know how tolerant you are until you're challenged on something you care about. This issue has touched some very raw nerves, and we find we're not as tolerant as we pretend to be.\"  At a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in September, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his officers.  \"I have never heard of training that consists of using stretchers for one class of prisoner and come-along holds for others based on the motivation of a crime,\" he said. \"All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest. I don't want them concerned with abortions, nuclear freezes, saving the whales or whatever.\"  Even before the commission met, conservative lawmakers were joining Sen. Armstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing legislation to restrain them.  Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) read into the Congressional Record a column by William F. Buckley Jr. comparing the West Hartford demonstrations to civil rights demonstrations in Alabama three decades ago: \"It is hard to believe that Bull Connor, directing white redneck policemen, caused more brutality in the treatment of blacks than was caused by the police of West Hartford in their treatment of members of Operation Rescue.\"  An amendment introduced by conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate, and tagged onto a HUD bill later signed by the President, states that no Community Planning and Development grants may be paid \"to any municipality that fails to adopt and enforce a policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law enforcement agencies within the jurisdiction of said municipality against any individuals engaged in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations.\"  Los Angeles received almost $56 million in such grants in fiscal year 1989. \"This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do,\" said Gates. \"Now we've got Republicans doing it.\"  The Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates pointed out.  .  Carol Sobel, staff attorney for the Los Angeles Chapter of the ACLU, shares Gates' assessment that the government acted in this case because conservative lawmakers were sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause. But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often \"barbaric,\" and she supports restraints on the police.  Sobel was \"amused\" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives.  Still, she believes the new measure will help assure \"that the cost of demonstrating in this town doesn't escalate. I just hope conservatives remember that it includes everyone.\"  Jim Cady in the Times Editorial Library assisted in the research for this article.  * NEW USE FOR OLD TOOL An ancient Asian farm tool has become a cutting edge weapon for many police officers in Southern California.

{"input": "  A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows <highlight_start>Los Angeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they are arresting<highlight_end>.\nThey press fingers under their noses.\n<highlight_start>They dig their knuckles into protesters' necks, and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists<highlight_end>.\nAt one point, two officers <highlight_start>twist a woman's arm<highlight_end> till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched in agony.\nIn another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along.\nHis arm, contorted behind his back, finally snaps.\n <highlight_start>The law enforcement name for these techniques is \"pain-compliance<highlight_end>.\"\nPolice departments nationwide say <highlight_start>it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate<highlight_end>.\nBut opponents call the term a euphemism for torture.\n Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago.\n<highlight_start>This time<highlight_end>, however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from <highlight_start>anti-abortion protesters<highlight_end> with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.\n <highlight_start>As a result, traditional political alliances have been turned topsy-turvy<highlight_end>.\nSuddenly, some <highlight_start>pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of \"police state\" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals<highlight_end>.\n In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican senator, decried pain-compliance as \"something we expect to hear about in Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America.\"\n Other conservative lawmakers have echoed his concerns, and on Nov. 15, with little media attention, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police use excessive force.\nMeanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.\n Caught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are howling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than $50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them.\n \"I think it's utter stupidity,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said.\n\"Utter, complete stupidity.\"\nIn reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used \"in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . .\nall through the '60s, all through the '70s,\" Gates said.\nHe smiled.\n\"You didn't hear any Republicans complain then, did you?\"\nWhile Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy about \"chokeholds\" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening situations as a result of fierce public pressure -- he argues that \"come-along\" techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest nonviolent demonstrators.\n His officers, he added, are as well-trained in the use of these holds as any in the country.\nOn a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds.\n Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: \"Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.\"\n Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether \"reasonable force\" included opening fire with her handgun.\n Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt.\nFred Nichols, the academy's expert on the use of force.\nThe least forceful tactic is a simple request -- \"Would you do this?\"\nPain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton.\n Among the most simple \"come-along\" compliance techniques are twist- and wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said.\nAnother trick of the trade: the \"mastoid lift,\" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the neck.\nDemonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly.\n But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and \"go limp\" when asked to move, others link arms.\nThey become \"human worm-balls\" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance techniques ineffective, officers say.\nTrying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.\n So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a \"police control device\" -- consisting of two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon.\n To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a \"trap-and-wrap\" maneuver.\nThe gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly.\n Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa.\nProtesters are given every chance to move on their own.\nPolice actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said.\nThen \"they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain.\nIt's a pain control technique,\" he said.\n\"It's going to hurt.\nThat's what pain-compliance means.\"\n <highlight_start>But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting nerve damage<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police<highlight_end> in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.\n Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.\n \"The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,\" Nichols said.\n\"With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark.\nIt's kind of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking.\nYou say, something's wrong here.\"\nIn the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt.\nPatrick E.

torque martial arts weapons around their wrists twist a woman's arm The law enforcement name for these techniques is \"pain-compliance it's a tried and true way to make uncooperative protesters cooperate This time anti-abortion protesters As a result, traditional political alliances have been turned topsy-turvy pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as conservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion Republicans are voicing the sort of \"police state\" rhetoric once associated with anti-war radicals But protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more conventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but lingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting nerve damage As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police In fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many think in the debate over police uses of force. But if this \"horrendous\" new measure has its intended effect, eliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, his department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe take over any facility they choose, he said. But, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any nonviolent demonstrator is often \"barbaric,\" and she supports restraints on the police", "unhighlights_concatenation": " A controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows  . They press fingers under their noses.  . At one point, two officers   till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched in agony. In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along. His arm, contorted behind his back, finally snaps.   .\" Police departments nationwide say  . But opponents call the term a euphemism for torture.  Demonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders launched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago.  , however, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes from   with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see themselves as law-and-order conservatives.   . Suddenly, some  .  In introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting nonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado's conservative Republican senator, decried pain-compliance as \"something we expect to hear about in Nicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America.\"  Other conservative lawmakers have echoed his concerns, and on Nov. 15, with little media attention, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police use excessive force. Meanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- has given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance to pain -- or even a martyr's appetite for it.  Caught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are howling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than $50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them.  \"I think it's utter stupidity,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said. \"Utter, complete stupidity.\" In reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term pain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used \"in civil rights demonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . . all through the '60s, all through the '70s,\" Gates said. He smiled. \"You didn't hear any Republicans complain then, did you?\" While Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy about \"chokeholds\" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening situations as a result of fierce public pressure -- he argues that \"come-along\" techniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest nonviolent demonstrators.  His officers, he added, are as well-trained in the use of these holds as any in the country. On a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed with the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, dressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or grappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds.  Reacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant's hand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man's chest, shouting: \"Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.\"  Had this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of synapses whether \"reasonable force\" included opening fire with her handgun.  Deadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in confronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt. Fred Nichols, the academy's expert on the use of force. The least forceful tactic is a simple request -- \"Would you do this?\" Pain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk but below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton.  Among the most simple \"come-along\" compliance techniques are twist- and wrist-locks, in which a subject's arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft tissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said. Another trick of the trade: the \"mastoid lift,\" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the neck. Demonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the Academy's playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly.  But while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience technique and \"go limp\" when asked to move, others link arms. They become \"human worm-balls\" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance techniques ineffective, officers say. Trying to carry away protesters in these cases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say.  So LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange County and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts tool called a nunchaku -- now termed a \"police control device\" -- consisting of two 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon.  To demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a cadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a \"trap-and-wrap\" maneuver. The gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly.  Nichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or compare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa. Protesters are given every chance to move on their own. Police actually plead with Operation Rescue demonstrators in some cases, he said. Then \"they're told they'll be subjected to excruciating pain. It's a pain control technique,\" he said. \"It's going to hurt. That's what pain-compliance means.\"    in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities.  Nichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue's charges.  \"The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,\" Nichols said. \"With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something's rotten in Denmark. It's kind of like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking. You say, something's wrong here.\" In the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt. Patrick E. McKinley of LAPD's Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary Communist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against everything from apartheid to animal rights. Operation Rescue protesters stand out, he said.  \"Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take action against abortion,\" he said in a sworn statement last August, given as part of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices.  Nichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle relaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue spokeswoman called \"100% incorrect.\"  In either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley. \"I'm no doctor. But pain has a purpose. It's telling you to stop doing what you're doing. If you don't respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are possible.\" In fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta. As Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil disobedience at clinics around the country, the allegations of police brutality increased:   * In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: \"Don't try to understand 'em, just round 'em up and brand 'em.\"  * In Pittsburgh, women claimed they were sexually molested by officers.  * In West Hartford, Conn., officers removed their badges and name tags -- purportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled protesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic handcuffs, or with \"crotch carries\" in which a night stick is stuck between the protester's legs. A priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting pain: \"The demonic element entered in here.\"  A woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: \"By the time they got my arms all the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . . ' Jesus! Jesus!' \" In demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and Denver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds after demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a form of \"curbside justice.\"  Implicit in the protesters' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed by kindred spirits.  \"It wasn't at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were calling the police pigs, being belligerent,\" said Dan Bruno, an accountant for the city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles demonstration. \"Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life. I've never been roughed up like that before. Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was like to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.\"  Operation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police. Rather, leaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt they had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file complaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A group called Pro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed \"real atrocities\" by the LAPD. But others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint. For example, feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she believes police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings and acting only after demonstrators failed to comply.  \"I can't have much sympathy for them,\" she said of the anti-abortion \"rescuers,\" as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice \"clinic defenders\" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton. \"The pain inflicted on women's lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous. What they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to what we've endured in exercising our constitutional rights.\" At demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well have been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police twist protesters' arms and chanted: \"L.A. blue, we're with you.\"  Chief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found support. \"I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the Christians to the lions,\" he said.  .  Village Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for letting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters' fight to restrain what he calls \"the torture police.\" He also has charged that his media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex issue.  William B. Allen, a controversial Ronald Reagan appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, has similar views: \"We like to value tolerance. But you never know how tolerant you are until you're challenged on something you care about. This issue has touched some very raw nerves, and we find we're not as tolerant as we pretend to be.\"  At a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in September, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his officers.  \"I have never heard of training that consists of using stretchers for one class of prisoner and come-along holds for others based on the motivation of a crime,\" he said. \"All I want my officers to think of at the time that they're taking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest. I don't want them concerned with abortions, nuclear freezes, saving the whales or whatever.\"  Even before the commission met, conservative lawmakers were joining Sen. Armstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing legislation to restrain them.  Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) read into the Congressional Record a column by William F. Buckley Jr. comparing the West Hartford demonstrations to civil rights demonstrations in Alabama three decades ago: \"It is hard to believe that Bull Connor, directing white redneck policemen, caused more brutality in the treatment of blacks than was caused by the police of West Hartford in their treatment of members of Operation Rescue.\"  An amendment introduced by conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate, and tagged onto a HUD bill later signed by the President, states that no Community Planning and Development grants may be paid \"to any municipality that fails to adopt and enforce a policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law enforcement agencies within the jurisdiction of said municipality against any individuals engaged in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations.\"  Los Angeles received almost $56 million in such grants in fiscal year 1989. \"This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into doing what the federal government wants it to do,\" said Gates. \"Now we've got Republicans doing it.\"  The Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates pointed out.  .  Carol Sobel, staff attorney for the Los Angeles Chapter of the ACLU, shares Gates' assessment that the government acted in this case because conservative lawmakers were sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause.  .  Sobel was \"amused\" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police brutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. policy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives.  Still, she believes the new measure will help assure \"that the cost of demonstrating in this town doesn't escalate. I just hope conservatives remember that it includes everyone.\"  Jim Cady in the Times Editorial Library assisted in the research for this article.  * NEW USE FOR OLD TOOL An ancient Asian farm tool has become a cutting edge weapon for many police officers in Southern California.

{"input": "  <highlight_start>Exxon Corp.<highlight_end> on Wednesday <highlight_start>increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to $2 billion<highlight_end> and said it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history.\nIn reporting its estimated 1989 earnings, Exxon said it would <highlight_start>take a $500-million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill<highlight_end> of 11 million gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez and fouled the shoreline of pristine Prince William Sound last March.\n The charges reduced Exxon's 1989 net income to $3.8 billion, compared to $5.26 billion in 1988.\nRevenue totaled $96.1 billion in 1989, compared to $88.6 billion the year before.\n On Wednesday, Exxon spokesman William Smith upped the company's estimate of the spill's total costs so far -- costs to Exxon and others -- to \"about $2 billion.\"\n<highlight_start>The figure does not include any liability from more than 150 lawsuits Exxon faces from the spill<highlight_end>, nor does it include additional cleanup costs should Exxon resume work in the spring.\n<highlight_start>The fourth-quarter charge comes in addition to $880 million that the company already set aside in the first and second quarters, bringing Exxon's total cleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion<highlight_end>.\nOther costs will be covered by \"more than $400 million\" in insurance, Smith said.\n Analysts were not surprised at the additional charge, though \"it was a lot bigger than I expected,\" said Joel D. Fischer, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.\nWall Street showed little reaction to the news, with Exxon's stock falling only 12.5 cents to close at $47 a share.\n \"The financial effect of the Exxon Valdez accident was clearly the major reason for lower net income in 1989,\" said Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a statement.\n The charges from the Valdez cleanup were partly offset by a one-time gain from a change in accounting methods in the first quarter as a result of changes in federal tax law.\nThat raised Exxon's income by $535 million for the year.\n Without the cleanup charge and accounting gain, Exxon said its net income for the year would have been $4.7 billion, down 10.6% from 1988, despite higher oil and gas prices.\nThe decline resulted mainly from slimmer refining and marketing profit margins and lower earnings from chemical operations.\nIn the fourth quarter, earnings before the Valdez charge were $1.28 billion, compared to $1.38 billion in the 1988 quarter.\n Analysts said <highlight_start>Exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage<highlight_end> from the charges.\n\"I think they did end the year on a strong note, largely because of the strength in crude and natural gas pricing,\" said Eugene Nowak, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.\n Still, <highlight_start>Exxon's stock<highlight_end>, whose performance has lagged behind that of other major oil firms, <highlight_start>could suffer from continuing negative publicity<highlight_end> surrounding the Valdez spill and the subsequent spill of 567,000 gallons of heating oil into the Arthur Kill waterway between New York and New Jersey on Jan. 2.\nThe bad press will undoubtedly be aggravated when the criminal trial begins next week of the Exxon Valdez's captain, Joseph Hazelwood.\n Smith declined to say what costs the new $500-million charge would cover.\nThe previous charges covered everything from wages to boat rentals to boots, as well as payments so far of $177 million in claims by fishermen, cannery workers and other individuals affected by the spill, said Exxon spokesman James Robertson in Anchorage.\nIn addition, the state of Alaska has asked Exxon to reimburse it for about $34.5 million in costs; so far, Exxon has paid the state $7.4 million in cash and has agreed to pay bills amounting to $23 million more, said the state's Oil Spill Coordinating Office.\nExxon must also reimburse the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal agencies.\nMeanwhile, Exxon confirmed Wednesday that it would shut down its Denver exploration and production office, which employs about 105 people.\nThe office's operations will be transferred to Midland, Tex.\nNo decision has been made on the future of the workers in Denver, said Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in Houston.\n", "gold_summary": "Exxon Corp. increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to $2 billion dollars and another $500 million will be taken in the fourth quarter for cleanup costs.\nThe figure does not include liability from more than 150 lawsuits that Exxon faces from the spill.\nThe fourth quarter charge is in addition to $880 million set aside in the first and second quarters, bring Exxon's total cleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion.\nExxon's size is said to insulate it from serious long-term financial damage.\nExxon's stock could suffer from continuing negative publicity.", "highlights": [{"text": "Exxon Corp", "score": 0.018}, {"text": "increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill", "score": 0.142}, {"text": "to $2 billion", "score": 0.035}, {"text": "take a $500-million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill", "score": 0.15}, {"text": "The figure does not include any liability from more than 150 lawsuits Exxon faces from the spill", "score": 0.15}, {"text": "The fourth-quarter charge comes in addition to $880 million that the company already set aside in the first and second quarters, bringing Exxon's total cleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion", "score": 0.319}, {"text": "Exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage", "score": 0.106}, {"text": "Exxon's stock", "score": 0.027}, {"text": "could suffer from continuing negative publicity", "score": 0.053}], "unhighlights": [{"text": "Wednesday", "score": 0.002}, {"text": "said it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history", "score": 0.046}, {"text": "it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history", "score": 0.044}, {"text": "cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history", "score": 0.022}, {"text": "is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history", "score": 0.015}, {"text": "said", "score": 0.002}, {"text": "said it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter", "score": 0.022}, {"text": "said it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what", "score": 0.031}, {"text": "it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter", "score": 0.02}, {"text": "it would take another $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what", "score": 0.029}, {"text": "cover costs from what", "score": 0.007}, {"text": "reporting its estimated 1989 earnings, Exxon said it", "score": 0.014}, {"text": "reporting its estimated 1989 earnings", "score": 0.009}, {"text": "Exxon said it", "score": 0.005}, {"text": "reporting its estimated 1989 earnings, Exxon said", "score": 0.012}, {"text": "11 million gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez", "score": 0.022}, {"text": "spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez", "score": 0.012}, {"text": "11 million gallons of oil", "score": 0.009}, {"text": "fouled the shoreline of pristine Prince William Sound last March", "score": 0.017}, {"text": "charges reduced Exxon's 1989 net income to $3.8 billion, compared to $5.26 billion in 1988", "score": 0.031}, {"text": "Revenue totaled $96.1 billion in 1989, compared to $88.6 billion the year before", "score": 0.026}, {"text": "Wednesday, Exxon spokesman William Smith upped the company's estimate of the spill's total costs so far -- costs to Exxon", "score": 0.036}, {"text": "others -- to \"about $2 billion", "score": 0.01}, {"text": "does it include additional cleanup costs should Exxon resume work in the spring", "score": 0.022}, {"text": "Exxon resume work in the spring", "score": 0.01}, {"text": "does it include additional cleanup costs", "score": 0.01}, {"text": "Other costs will be covered by \"more than $400 million\" in insurance, Smith said", "score": 0.026}, {"text": "Other costs will be covered by \"more than $400 million\" in insurance", "score": 0.022}, {"text": "Smith said", "score": 0.003}, {"text": "Analysts were not surprised at the additional charge, though \"it was a lot bigger than I expected,\" said Joel D.

Without the cleanup charge and accounting gain, Exxon said its net income for the year would have been $4.7 billion, down 10.6% from 1988, despite higher oil and gas prices. The decline resulted mainly from slimmer refining and marketing profit margins and lower earnings from chemical operations. In the fourth quarter, earnings before the Valdez charge were $1.28 billion, compared to $1.38 billion in the 1988 quarter.  Analysts said Exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage from the charges. \"I think they did end the year on a strong note, largely because of the strength in crude and natural gas pricing,\" said Eugene Nowak, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.

{"input": "  As they scanned the flow of passengers <highlight_start>at Los Angeles International Airport<highlight_end>, police <highlight_start>detective Clayton Searle<highlight_end> and his fellow narcotics officer <highlight_start>searched for<highlight_end> the likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby.\n When <highlight_start>Searle noticed a<highlight_end> short, muscular black <highlight_start>man<highlight_end> walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police detective moved in quickly to question him.\nWithin minutes, however, their words had turned into violence, and the two men toppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed his <highlight_start>suspect<highlight_end> and pulled him to his feet.\nPlacing his hand across the man's mouth, the officer then marched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby.\n Only later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration realize that <highlight_start>the suspected drug courier<highlight_end> they had arrested on that March day in 1988 <highlight_start>was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman<highlight_end> who was inducted Monday into Major League baseball's Hall of Fame.\n The 46-year-old <highlight_start>Morgan<highlight_end>, who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster, <highlight_start>is suing<highlight_end> Searle and the city of Los Angeles <highlight_start>in federal court, claiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is black and fit a certain \"profile\" that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like<highlight_end>.\n \"There's no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by,\" said William Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer.\n The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports.\n \"It's purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any drug activity,\" said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases.\n First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to transport narcotics.\nSuch suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics.\n Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers.\nBut the court said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior, not just on race or appearance.\n \"Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what the profile is I cannot tell you,\" said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr.\nWilliam Booth.\n\"It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism.\nIt's based on trying to protect the public.\"\nHe said that last year, 254 narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport.\nThrough Aug. 3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests.\n Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that his agency uses drug courier profiles.\n \"We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them,\" he said.\n Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles.\nMorgan is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated.\n Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case.\nBut two months later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after ruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally detained by police.\n \"There isn't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal,\" the judge concluded.\n Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did anything wrong.\n \"I wish that this hadn't happened,\" Searle said.\n\"I wish (Morgan) luck now that I know who he is.\nI just hope I never see him again.\"\n Morgan could not be reached for comment.\nBut in court documents, <highlight_start>he said that on March 15, 1988<highlight_end>, he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and <highlight_start>was<highlight_end> innocently <highlight_start>making a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.\n Asked to identify himself<highlight_end>, Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him retrieve it.\nWhen a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that Searle warned the man to stay away.\n Minutes later, Morgan said, <highlight_start>Searle grabbed him by the neck and they fell to the floor<highlight_end>.\nMorgan said <highlight_start>the officer then put a knee in his back<highlight_end>, wrenched his arms behind him <highlight_start>and handcuffed him<highlight_end>.\nHe was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said.\nSearle then offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgan's lawsuit.\nInstead, Morgan filed his complaint, in part, to discourage similar incidents from occurring, his attorneys said.\n \"This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person who uses Los Angeles airport,\" said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also is black.\n\"If it wasn't Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to any other black person.\"\n Searle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times he could not discuss specifics of the case.\n \"All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a good announcer,\" Searle said.\n\"I wish it didn't happen.\nHe just sort of went out of control.\"\n Assistant City Atty.\nHoney A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police Department, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to identify himself when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities and slapping the officer.\n \"My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted,\" Lewis said.\n\"If he had cooperated, none of this would have happened.\nI think he had a bruised ego, and he was offended because the officer hadn't recognized him.\"\n According to Searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and Woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier.\nThey said he was using an alias.\nAlthough the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began looking for his companion.\nSince the passenger was black and indicated that his companion \"looked like me,\" the officer began looking for a black man who was nervous-looking or having \"other characteristics of a narcotics courier.\"\n When they spotted Morgan, Searle said, he tried to speak to him but Morgan started screaming profanities and \"making animal noises\" and hit him in the chest with a wild swing.\n In his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered \"acute physical and emotional distress and embarrassment\" after the incident and expressed concern about damage to his reputation.\n RELATED STORY: C14 ", "gold_summary": "On March 15, 1988 detective Clayton Searle was at the Los Angeles International Airport

When   short, muscular black   walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police detective moved in quickly to question him. Within minutes, however, their words had turned into violence, and the two men toppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed his   and pulled him to his feet. Placing his hand across the man's mouth, the officer then marched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby.  Only later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration realize that   they had arrested on that March day in 1988   who was inducted Monday into Major League baseball's Hall of Fame.  The 46-year-old  , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster,   Searle and the city of Los Angeles  .  \"There's no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by,\" said William Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer.  The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports.  \"It's purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any drug activity,\" said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases.  First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to transport narcotics. Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics.  Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers. But the court said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior, not just on race or appearance.  \"Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what the profile is I cannot tell you,\" said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. William Booth. \"It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism. It's based on trying to protect the public.\" He said that last year, 254 narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport. Through Aug. 3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests.  Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that his agency uses drug courier profiles.  \"We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them,\" he said.  Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles. Morgan is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated.  Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case. But two months later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after ruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally detained by police.  \"There isn't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal,\" the judge concluded.  Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did anything wrong.  \"I wish that this hadn't happened,\" Searle said. \"I wish (Morgan) luck now that I know who he is. I just hope I never see him again.\"  Morgan could not be reached for comment. But in court documents,  , he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and   innocently  , Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him retrieve it. When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that Searle warned the man to stay away.  Minutes later, Morgan said,  . Morgan said  , wrenched his arms behind him  . He was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said. Searle then offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgan's lawsuit. Instead, Morgan filed his complaint, in part, to discourage similar incidents from occurring, his attorneys said.  \"This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person who uses Los Angeles airport,\" said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also is black. \"If it wasn't Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to any other black person.\"  Searle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times he could not discuss specifics of the case.  \"All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a good announcer,\" Searle said. \"I wish it didn't happen. He just sort of went out of control.\"  Assistant City Atty. Honey A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police Department, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to identify himself when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities and slapping the officer.  \"My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted,\" Lewis said. \"If he had cooperated, none of this would have happened. I think he had a bruised ego, and he was offended because the officer hadn't recognized him.\"  According to Searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and Woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier. They said he was using an alias. Although the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began looking for his companion. Since the passenger was black and indicated that his companion \"looked like me,\" the officer began looking for a black man who was nervous-looking or having \"other characteristics of a narcotics courier.\"  When they spotted Morgan, Searle said, he tried to speak to him but Morgan started screaming profanities and \"making animal noises\" and hit him in the chest with a wild swing.  In his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered \"acute physical and emotional distress and embarrassment\" after the incident and expressed concern about damage to his reputation.

First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to transport narcotics. Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics.    U.S.  . But the court said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior,  .  \"Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what the profile is I cannot tell you,\" said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. William Booth. \"It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism. It's based on trying to protect the public.\" He said that last year, 254 narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport. Through Aug. 3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests.  Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that his agency uses drug courier profiles.  \"We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them,\" he said.  Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles. Morgan is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated.  Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case. But two months later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after ruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally detained by police.  \"There isn't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal,\" the judge concluded.  Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did anything wrong.  \"I wish that this hadn't happened,\" Searle said. \"I wish (Morgan) luck now that I know who he is. I just hope I never see him again.\"  Morgan could not be reached for comment. But in court documents, he said that on March 15, 1988, he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and was innocently making a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.  Asked to identify himself, Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him retrieve it. When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that Searle warned the man to stay away.  Minutes later, Morgan said, Searle grabbed him by the neck and they fell to the floor. Morgan said the officer then put a knee in his back, wrenched his arms behind him and handcuffed him. He was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said. Searle then offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgan's lawsuit. Instead, Morgan filed his complaint, in part, to discourage similar incidents from occurring, his attorneys said.  \"This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person who uses Los Angeles airport,\" said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also is black. \"If it wasn't Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to any other black person.\"  Searle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times he could not discuss specifics of the case.  \"All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a good announcer,\" Searle said. \"I wish it didn't happen. He just sort of went out of control.\"  Assistant City Atty. Honey A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police Department, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to identify himself when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities and slapping the officer.  \"My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted,\" Lewis said. \"If he had cooperated, none of this would have happened. I think he had a bruised ego, and he was offended because the officer hadn't recognized him.\"  According to Searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and Woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier. They said he was using an alias. Although the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began looking for his companion. Since the passenger was black and indicated that his companion \"looked like me,\" the officer began looking for a black man who was nervous-looking or having \"other characteristics of a narcotics courier.\"  When they spotted Morgan, Searle said, he tried to speak to him but Morgan started screaming profanities and \"making animal noises\" and hit him in the chest with a wild swing.  In his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered \"acute physical and emotional distress and embarrassment\" after the incident and expressed concern about damage to his reputation.

Placing his hand across the man's mouth, the officer then marched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby.  Only   did   and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration   the suspected drug courier   on that March day in 1988 was   who was   Monday   Major League baseball's  .  The 46-year-old  , who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball broadcaster,   in federal court, claiming that   unfairly  \" that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like.  \"There's no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was because he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by,\" said William Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer.  The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports.  \"It's purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any drug activity,\" said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases.  First developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of behavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to transport narcotics. Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics.  Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and question airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers. But the court said brief detentions must be based on a person's behavior, not just on race or appearance.  \"Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what the profile is I cannot tell you,\" said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. William Booth. \"It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism. It's based on trying to protect the public.\" He said that last year, 254 narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport. Through Aug. 3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests.  Frank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that his agency uses drug courier profiles.  \"We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people involved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them,\" he said.  Neither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles. Morgan is seeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated.  Last April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan's case. But two months later, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after ruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally detained by police.  \"There isn't any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal,\" the judge concluded.  Both Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA agent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did anything wrong.  \"I wish that this hadn't happened,\" Searle said. \"I wish (Morgan) luck now that I know who he is. I just hope I never see him again.\"  Morgan could not be reached for comment. But in court documents, he said that on  , he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a connecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and was innocently making a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed his shoulder and spun him around.  Asked to identify himself, Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was in an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him retrieve it. When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- recognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that Searle warned the man to stay away.  Minutes later, Morgan said, Searle grabbed him by the neck and they fell to the floor. Morgan said the officer then put a knee in his back, wrenched his arms behind him and handcuffed him. He was taken to a small children's nursery in the terminal and interrogated, but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said. Searle then offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgan's lawsuit. Instead, Morgan filed his complaint, in part, to discourage similar incidents from occurring, his attorneys said.  \"This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person who uses Los Angeles airport,\" said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also is black. \"If it wasn't Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to any other black person.\"  Searle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times he could not discuss specifics of the case.  \"All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a good announcer,\" Searle said. \"I wish it didn't happen. He just sort of went out of control.\"  Assistant City Atty. Honey A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police Department, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to identify himself when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities and slapping the officer.  \"My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted,\" Lewis said. \"If he had cooperated, none of this would have happened. I think he had a bruised ego, and he was offended because the officer hadn't recognized him.\"  According to Searle's sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and Woessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier. They said he was using an alias. Although the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began looking for his companion. Since the passenger   and indicated that his companion \"looked like me,\" the officer began looking for  .\"  When they spotted Morgan, Searle said, he tried to speak to him but Morgan started screaming profanities and \"making animal noises\" and hit him in the chest with a wild swing.  In his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered \"acute physical and emotional distress and embarrassment\" after the incident and expressed concern about damage to his reputation.

{"input": " Flexing its muscles as a cartel, <highlight_start>De Beers<highlight_end> Consolidated Mines Ltd. <highlight_start>is raising its diamond prices an average 10% next month<highlight_end>.\nThe South African concern, which controls 80% of the world diamond market through its London-based <highlight_start>Central Selling Organization<highlight_end>, sells a vast array of diamonds, varying in quality and size, dealers say.\nSo the increase could be as much as 20% on top-grade diamonds.\nThe rise follows an average price increase of 14.5% last year.\n\"The diamond price increase was expected,\" said Jacques Zucker, of Lachowsky Zucker, diamond dealers in Antwerp, Belgium.\nBy changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, De Beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said.\n\"Few listened to us two years ago when we advised clients to buy diamonds at depressed values,\" Mr. Zucker said.\n\"Now they must accept higher prices.\"\n\"The price rise provides the necessary psychological lift to the market,\" said Peter Miller, a mining analyst at Shearson Lehman Securities in London.\nIt will help the diamond producers \"consolidate their gains.\"\n<highlight_start>Prices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds have risen<highlight_end> to about $14,800 a carat <highlight_start>from $12,000<highlight_end> at the beginning of the year, dealers said.\nIn 1985, at the low point of a deep slump, a top quality stone was $8,500 a carat, down from an average of $55,000 in 1980.\n<highlight_start>A carat equals 200 milligrams<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>De Beers decided to raise prices because<highlight_end> rough diamonds were already trading at a premium over its own quotes on the open market, said Andrew Lamont, a company spokesman.\nDemand is especially buoyant in the Far East.\nIn the first seven months of 1987, <highlight_start>Japanese imports of<highlight_end> polished <highlight_start>diamonds surged<highlight_end> 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added.\nAfter <highlight_start>the U.S.<highlight_end>, <highlight_start>Japan is the second biggest diamond<highlight_end> jewelry <highlight_start>market<highlight_end>, followed by West Germany.\n<highlight_start>Only one out of 17 Japanese couples bought<highlight_end> engagement rings less than two decades ago; <highlight_start>now more than two-thirds buy<highlight_end>.\n\"The sharp appreciation of the yen reduced the cost of <highlight_start>diamonds<highlight_end> for Japanese buyers,\" Mr. Lamont says.\nStronger currencies and lower interest rates in West Germany and other European countries also boosted diamond sales, he says.\nDiamonds are priced in U.S. dollars.\n<highlight_start>Demand for<highlight_end> polished <highlight_start>diamonds<highlight_end> in the U.S., Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, and the Philippines also <highlight_start>raised<highlight_end> exports of the leading diamond cutting and dealing centers, primarily Antwerp, Tel Aviv, Bombay and New York.\nTo meet growing orders from diamond dealers and cutters who supply the retail trade, De Beers sales of rough diamonds jumped to $1.56 billion in the first half of this year from $1.2 billion in the similar period in 1986.\nSales of $2.56 billion last year were the highest since the 1980 boom when De Beers turnover reached $2.72 billion.\nAnalysts are predicting sales of $3 billion in 1987.\nYet some dealers worry because world diamond production surged to 89.6 million carats last year from 47 million carats in 1982.\nOnly about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but De Beers must continue to find new markets, they say.\n<highlight_start>De Beers<highlight_end> surprised skeptics and revived trade from the slump in the first half of the decade by withholding stocks and pursuing an intensive marketing <highlight_start>campaign<highlight_end>.\nAn <highlight_start>advertising and promotion<highlight_end> budget which rose to $110 million this year from $43 million in 1980 helped raise world-wide sales of diamond jewelry to a record 49 million pieces valued at $24.6 billion last year.\nIn 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says.\nIn more than half a century of its existence, the Central Selling Organization, which includes as members black African state producers, has outlasted other commodity cartels by never cutting diamond prices.\nThe cartel controls

{"input": " Who is this man a multi-million dollar ad campaign and a senator from Massachusetts said would turn back the clock on civil rights to the days of segregated lunch counters?\nWho is this man who would want to reopen such old national wounds?\nRobert Bork was the young associate in a Chicago law firm who in 1957 demanded that the partners end their Jewish quota and hire Howard Krane.\nMr. Krane is now a senior partner there, and told the Judiciary Committee that \"Bob Bork is a person without prejudice against any group.\"\nU.S. Solicitor General Bork was quick to rescue Jewel Lafontant, the first black woman to be a deputy in that office, when she told him of her exclusion from meetings due to her sex.\n\"The very next day was the beginning of my attending so many briefings,\" Ms. Lafontant told the senators, \"I wondered to myself whether I had been wise in complaining.\"\nThe deeds of Robert Bork in his personal life are matched by the words of his professional duties as appeals court judge and solicitor general.\nThe evidence is that the <highlight_start>distortions of Mr. Bork's civil-rights record are<highlight_end> nothing more -- or less -- than <highlight_start>a<highlight_end> grotesque <highlight_start>lie<highlight_end>.\n--Record as Appeals Judge.\nBork opponents have tried to substitute result-oriented statistics for careful analysis of his legal reasoning to impugn <highlight_start>Judge Bork<highlight_end> as anti-women, pro-business, etc.\nYet even on the basis of the opposition's anti-intellectual methods, Judge Bork's civil-rights record is clear.\nIn his five years <highlight_start>on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia<highlight_end>, Judge Bork has heard eight cases involving the rights of minorities or women -- and ruled in their favor in seven.\n<highlight_start>In no case did he render an opinion less sympathetic to minority or women's rights than the Supreme Court<highlight_end>.\nPerhaps even more telling, <highlight_start>his opinions are among the circuit's most notable<highlight_end> civil-rights <highlight_start>rulings<highlight_end>.\nIn this year's Emory v. Secretary of the Navy, Judge Bork ruled for a black Navy captain who wanted to sue the promotions board.\nThe issue was whether the military branches are subject to judicial review where civil rights are at stake.\nJudge Bork held for the first time that federal courts can decide these cases.\nAlso this year, in Doe v. Weinberger, Judge Bork held that a plaintiff fired from the National Security Agency due to his homosexuality was illegally denied a hearing.\nJudge Bork has written or joined several opinions protecting women's rights, especially at work: Laffey v. Northwest Airlines (1984) demanded that stewardesses get paid as much as male pursers for comparable work; Palmer v. Shultz (1987) held for women foreign service officers alleging discrimination by the State Department in assignments and promotions; and Ososky v. Wick (1983) reversed the lower court to bring women in the Foreign Service under Equal Pay Act protections.\n--Record <highlight_start>as Solicitor General<highlight_end>.\nWhen the critics ask, where was Robert Bork during the great civil-rights victories?\nthe best answer is that he was standing in front of the Supreme Court making the winning arguments.\nIndeed, perhaps the best measure of Robert Bork's civil-rights record is his four years as the government's chief litigator.\nSolicitors general have great freedom to file briefs weighing the claims of private parties in cases where they are not required to act as the government's defense lawyer.\n<highlight_start>Mr. Bork<highlight_end> used his position to <highlight_start>argue more pro-civil rights cases than any Supreme Court nominee since Thurgood Marshall<highlight_end>.\nIn 17 of the 19 cases, Solicitor General Bork argued for the civil rights plaintiff or minority interest; <highlight_start>the NAACP Legal Defense Fund was on his side in nine of the 10 cases where both filed briefs<highlight_end>.\nIndeed, perhaps the most lasting accomplishment of his solicitor generalship in the mid-1970s was building on the civil rights gains of the 1960s.\nHe was ahead of the times in 1976 in Runyon v. McCrary.\nThe issue was whether private schools can deny admission to blacks.\nThis controversial case raised the conflict between the freedom of private groups to set their own rules and the public goal of non-discrimination.\nThe civil-rights law, Solicitor General Bork said, \"reaches the actions of private individuals not in any way facilitated by state law.\"\nThe Supreme Court agreed, with Lewis Powell dissenting.\nIn several cases, Solicitor General Bork took the controversial position that plaintiffs do not have to prove the defendant's discriminatory intent in order to win discrimination cases.\nBlack workers brought the 1975 case of Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody against their employer and their union.\nThey argued that they had been locked into low-paying jobs by testing policies and union rules.\nMr. Bork successfully argued that even if the employer didn't mean to discriminate against black workers, the mere existence of a discriminatory effect entitled the plaintiffs to back pay.\nSolicitor General Bork tried to take the law even further.\nIn the 1977 case of Teamsters v. U.S., the Supreme Court refused to accept his argument that a wholly race-neutral seniority system is unlawful if it perpetuates discriminatory effects.\n<highlight_start>Despite Judge Bork's record<highlight_end> of public service to civil rights, <highlight_start>Sen.<highlight_end> Joseph <highlight_start>Biden claimed that \"throughout his career, Judge Bork has opposed virtually every civil rights advance.<highlight_end>\"\n<highlight_start>How can this be?\n<highlight_end>The critics cite Mr. Bork's speculative academic writings -- yet distort even these: --Brown v. Board of Education.\nWhatever Sen. Biden was referring to, it couldn't have been the landmark Supreme Court case that desegregated the public schools and gave courage to a politically deadlocked Congress to act on civil rights.\nJudge Bork has said that by the 1954 Brown case, \"it had become abundantly apparent through repeated litigation that separate was never equal.\"\nThis isn't a recent conversion: In a 1968 Fortune article, he called the ruling \"surely correct.\"\nIn his 1971 Indiana Law Review article, then-Yale Prof. Bork said that the 14th Amendment \"was intended to enforce a core idea of black equality against governmental discrimination.\"\nAt a Federalist Society meeting this past January, Judge Bork defended Brown's reasoning against critics who insisted that the 14th Amendment was not intended to prohibit segregated schools.\nHe said, \"To have chosen separation rather than equality would have been to read the equal protection clause out of the Constitution.\"\nJudge Bork calls Brown \"perhaps the greatest moral achievement of our constitutional law.\"\n--Public Accommodations.\nMuch has been made of Mr. Bork's three-page article in The New Republic in 1963 making the libertarian case against government-coerced desegregation of private establishments.\nUnlike the segregationists, he was not motivated by a desire for racial separation.\nIndeed, he stipulated that \"of the ugliness of racial discrimination there need be no argument.\"\nInstead, his purpose was to warn against the dangers of government intervention into private relations even for a cause as noble as desegregation.\n\"It is sad to have to defend the principle of freedom in this context,\" he wrote, \"but the task ought not to be left to those Southern politicians who only a short while ago were defending laws that enforced racial segregation.\"\nRobert Bork long ago rejected the extreme libertarian argument.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"did an enormous amount to bring the country together and bring blacks into the mainstream,\" he said at his 1973 confirmation hearings as solicitor general.\n\"That is the way I should have judged the statute in the first place instead of on these abstract libertarian principles.\"\nDoes this sound like someone who would undo racial progress?\n--Voting Rights.\nCritics of Judge Bork make the startling claim that he favors poll taxes, the device once used to deny blacks their right to vote.\nJudge Bork told the Judiciary Committee that he has \"no desire to bring poll taxes back into existence.\nI do not like them myself.\"\nHe has criticized Harper v. Virginia Board of Education, the 1966 case that invalidated state poll taxes.\nBut the case had nothing to do with race.\nThe high court in Harper explicitly said that there was no evidence of any racially discriminatory application of the $1.50 poll tax.\nJudge Bork told the committee that if the tax had been \"applied in a discriminatory fashion, it would have clearly been unconstitutional.\"\nJudge Bork's point was that if there is no racial discrimination, then there can be no equal-protection-clause justification to invalidate a state poll tax.\nThe 24th Amendment, he noted, prohibited only federal poll taxes, intentionally leaving states free to assess such taxes if they chose.\nJudge Bork has said that a better ground for invalidating a poll tax would be if it were so high an amount that it interfered with the constitutional provision guaranteeing a republican form of government.\nApart from Judge Bork's extraordinary civil-rights record, there is a strong argument that minorities above all others should demand judicial restraint and an honest reading of the Constitution and its civil rights amendments.\nIf justices of the William Brennan variety can make the Constitution mean what they like it to mean, the Supreme Court becomes another branch of government subject to buffeting by public opinion.\nThe history of activist judges until recently is a history of black oppression; justices in Plessey v. Ferguson (1896) ignored the text of the 14th Amendment to create separate but equal.\nJudges such as Robert Bork insist that the law adhere to the Constitution, preserving a text that protects minority rights that today could again lose popularvor.\nA reading of Judge Bork's voluminous cvil rights record leaves the inescapable conclusion that the partisan campaign against him was one of intentional distortion.\nIf only the special interests had shown a fraction of the compassion for the truth as Robert Bork has shown for minorities.\nAs it is, senators who take the time to review his

Robert Bork was the young associate in a Chicago law firm who in 1957 demanded that the partners end their Jewish quota and hire Howard Krane. Mr. Krane is now a senior partner there, and told the Judiciary Committee that \"Bob Bork is a person without prejudice against any group.\" U.S. Solicitor General Bork was quick to rescue Jewel Lafontant, the first black woman to be a deputy in that office, when she told him of her exclusion from meetings due to her sex. \"The very next day was the beginning of my attending so many briefings,\" Ms. Lafontant told the senators, \"I wondered to myself whether I had been wise in complaining.\" The deeds of Robert Bork in his personal life are matched by the words of his professional duties as appeals court judge and solicitor general.

Bork opponents have tried to substitute result-oriented statistics for careful analysis of his legal reasoning to impugn   as anti-women, pro-business, etc. Yet even on the basis of the opposition's anti-intellectual methods, Judge Bork's civil-rights record is clear. In his five years  , Judge Bork has heard eight cases involving the rights of minorities or women -- and ruled in their favor in seven.  . Perhaps even more telling,   civil-rights  . In this year's Emory v. Secretary of the Navy, Judge Bork ruled for a black Navy captain who wanted to sue the promotions board. The issue was whether the military branches are subject to judicial review where civil rights are at stake. Judge Bork held for the first time that federal courts can decide these cases. Also this year, in Doe v. Weinberger, Judge Bork held that a plaintiff fired from the National Security Agency due to his homosexuality was illegally denied a hearing. Judge Bork has written or joined several opinions protecting women's rights, especially at work: Laffey v. Northwest Airlines (1984) demanded that stewardesses get paid as much as male pursers for comparable work; Palmer v. Shultz (1987) held for women foreign service officers alleging discrimination by the State Department in assignments and promotions; and Ososky v. Wick (1983) reversed the lower court to bring women in the Foreign Service under Equal Pay Act protections. --Record  . When the critics ask, where was Robert Bork during the great civil-rights victories? the best answer is that he was standing in front of the Supreme Court making the winning arguments. Indeed, perhaps the best measure of Robert Bork's civil-rights record is his four years as the government's chief litigator. Solicitors general have great freedom to file briefs weighing the claims of private parties in cases where they are not required to act as the government's defense lawyer.   used his position to  . In 17 of the 19 cases, Solicitor General Bork argued for the civil rights plaintiff or minority interest;  . Indeed, perhaps the most lasting accomplishment of his solicitor generalship in the mid-1970s was building on the civil rights gains of the 1960s. He was ahead of the times in 1976 in Runyon v. McCrary. The issue was whether private schools can deny admission to blacks. This controversial case raised the conflict between the freedom of private groups to set their own rules and the public goal of non-discrimination. The civil-rights law, Solicitor General Bork said, \"reaches the actions of private individuals not in any way facilitated by state law.\" The Supreme Court agreed, with Lewis Powell dissenting. In several cases, Solicitor General Bork took the controversial position that plaintiffs do not have to prove the defendant's discriminatory intent in order to win discrimination cases. Black workers brought the 1975 case of Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody against their employer and their union. They argued that they had been locked into low-paying jobs by testing policies and union rules. Mr. Bork successfully argued that even if the employer didn't mean to discriminate against black workers, the mere existence of a discriminatory effect entitled the plaintiffs to back pay. Solicitor General Bork tried to take the law even further. In the 1977 case of Teamsters v. U.S., the Supreme Court refused to accept his argument that a wholly race-neutral seniority system is unlawful if it perpetuates discriminatory effects.   of public service to civil rights,   Joseph  The critics cite Mr. Bork's speculative academic writings -- yet distort even these: --Brown v. Board of Education. Whatever Sen. Biden was referring to, it couldn't have been the landmark Supreme Court case that desegregated the public schools and gave courage to a politically deadlocked Congress to act on civil rights. Judge Bork has said that by the 1954 Brown case, \"it had become abundantly apparent through repeated litigation that separate was never equal.\" This isn't a recent conversion: In a 1968 Fortune article, he called the ruling \"surely correct.\" In his 1971 Indiana Law Review article, then-Yale Prof. Bork said that the 14th Amendment \"was intended to enforce a core idea of black equality against governmental discrimination.\" At a Federalist Society meeting this past January, Judge Bork defended Brown's reasoning against critics who insisted that the 14th Amendment was not intended to prohibit segregated schools. He said, \"To have chosen separation rather than equality would have been to read the equal protection clause out of the Constitution.\" Judge Bork calls Brown \"perhaps the greatest moral achievement of our constitutional law.\" --Public Accommodations. Much has been made of Mr. Bork's three-page article in The New Republic in 1963 making the libertarian case against government-coerced desegregation of private establishments. Unlike the segregationists, he was not motivated by a desire for racial separation. Indeed, he stipulated that \"of the ugliness of racial discrimination there need be no argument.\" Instead, his purpose was to warn against the dangers of government intervention into private relations even for a cause as noble as desegregation. \"It is sad to have to defend the principle of freedom in this context,\" he wrote, \"but the task ought not to be left to those Southern politicians who only a short while ago were defending laws that enforced racial segregation.\" Robert Bork long ago rejected the extreme libertarian argument. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"did an enormous amount to bring the country together and bring blacks into the mainstream,\" he said at his 1973 confirmation hearings as solicitor general. \"That is the way I should have judged the statute in the first place instead of on these abstract libertarian principles.\" Does this sound like someone who would undo racial progress? --Voting Rights. Critics of Judge Bork make the startling claim that he favors poll taxes, the device once used to deny blacks their right to vote. Judge Bork told the Judiciary Committee that he has \"no desire to bring poll taxes back into existence. I do not like them myself.\" He has criticized Harper v. Virginia Board of Education, the 1966 case that invalidated state poll taxes. But the case had nothing to do with race. The high court in Harper explicitly said that there was no evidence of any racially discriminatory application of the $1.50 poll tax. Judge Bork told the committee that if the tax had been \"applied in a discriminatory fashion, it would have clearly been unconstitutional.\" Judge Bork's point was that if there is no racial discrimination, then there can be no equal-protection-clause justification to invalidate a state poll tax. The 24th Amendment, he noted, prohibited only federal poll taxes, intentionally leaving states free to assess such taxes if they chose. Judge Bork has said that a better ground for invalidating a poll tax would be if it were so high an amount that it interfered with the constitutional provision guaranteeing a republican form of government. Apart from Judge Bork's extraordinary civil-rights record, there is a strong argument that minorities above all others should demand judicial restraint and an honest reading of the Constitution and its civil rights amendments. If justices of the William Brennan variety can make the Constitution mean what they like it to mean, the Supreme Court becomes another branch of government subject to buffeting by public opinion. The history of activist judges until recently is a history of black oppression; justices in Plessey v. Ferguson (1896) ignored the text of the 14th Amendment to create separate but equal. Judges such as Robert Bork insist that the law adhere to the Constitution, preserving a text that protects minority rights that today could again lose popularvor. A reading of Judge Bork's voluminous cvil rights record leaves the inescapable conclusion that the partisan campaign against him was one of intentional distortion. If only the special interests had shown a fraction of the compassion for the truth as Robert Bork has shown for minorities. As it is, senators who take the time to review his record will find no honest argument that minorities or women have anything to fear from a Justice Bork. --- Mr. Crovitz is assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page."}

similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district judge in Pittsburgh ruled that the states that sued -- Pennsylvania, Kansas and Alabama -- couldn't show they had been harmed.\nThe Constitution simply calls for apportioning the House on the basis of the \"the whole number of persons\" in each state.\nThe Constitution originally called for counting \"free persons\" and indentured servants, and for counting slaves as three-fifths of a person.\nThat was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868.\nOnly \"Indians not taxed\" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since 1940.\nMuch of the argument in Congress turns on the use of the word \"person\" in references to the census.\nElsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word \"citizen.\"\nThey wrote, for instance, that only those who have been \"seven years a citizen of the United States\" can serve in the House.\nThe word \"person\" was repeated in the 14th Amendment,

Wisconsin has   illegal immigrants; Arizona has lots. \"It boils down to regional politics,\" says Arturo Vargas, census-program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants. Counting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat in the House for Pennsylvania and one more for California, according to the private Population Reference Bureau. The Census Bureau's chief antagonist in the Senate, Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), says seats for Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina and Alabama also are at risk. On the other hand, Texas, Florida and New York could benefit. \" ,\" says David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.  , based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants   1980, half of them in California. That meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia. \"You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals,\" says Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.), who leads the charge against the practice in the House. Organizations that represent Hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign.   and blacks. \"As it is, the Census Bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential,\" Mr. Vargas says. \"If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder.\" The Census Bureau agrees. \"We tell people: Put your name down on the census form. We won't report you to the housing authority {if there are too many occupants},\" says Peter Bonpanne, an assistant director. \"If they see a lot of questions on there about somebody's legal status, that could hurt all kinds of people's participation.\" Although the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if Congress acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, Mr. Bonpanne says. The bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens. To satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn't a citizen. Rep. Ridge dismisses the practical problems. \"We're spending billions on the census, and the only thing we get is a bunch of belly-aching about how difficult it will be,\"  . \"The primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power . . . not to gather demographic information.\" The Senate, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract  .

The House did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from \"knowingly\" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds.  . In 1980, a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court decision throwing out a suit that sought to bar the government from counting illegal immigrants. A similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district judge in Pittsburgh ruled that the states that sued -- Pennsylvania, Kansas and Alabama -- couldn't show they had been harmed. The Constitution simply calls for apportioning the House on the basis of the \"the whole number of persons\" in each state. The Constitution originally called for counting \"free persons\" and indentured servants, and for counting slaves as three-fifths of a person. That was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868. Only \"Indians not taxed\" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since 1940. Much of the argument in Congress turns on the use of the word \"person\" in references to the census. Elsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word \"citizen.\" They wrote, for instance, that only those who have been \"seven years a citizen of the United States\" can serve in the House. The word \"person\" was repeated in the 14th Amendment, which was drafted after the Civil War.

Jim Kolbe (R., Ariz.): \"A very clear reading of the Constitution says that we shall count all those who are present.\"\nAlthough <highlight_start>the debate is often couched in constitutional arguments, it's largely driven by geography.<highlight_end>\nWisconsin has few illegal immigrants; Arizona has lots.\n\"It boils down to regional <highlight_start>politics<highlight_end>,\" says Arturo Vargas, census-program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants.\n<highlight_start>Counting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat<highlight_end> in the House <highlight_start>for Pennsylvania and one more for California<highlight_end>, according to the private Population Reference Bureau.\nThe Census Bureau's chief antagonist in the Senate, Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), says <highlight_start>seats for Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina and Alabama also are at risk.\nOn the other hand, Texas, Florida and New York could benefit.\n<highlight_end>\"Illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from Americans,\" says David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.\nThe Census Bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in California.\nThat meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia.\n\"You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals,\" says Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.), who leads the charge against the practice in the House.\nOrganizations that represent Hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign.\nThey fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the Census Bureau already faces in accurately counting Hispanics and blacks.\n\"As it is, the Census Bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential,\" Mr. Vargas says.\n\"If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder.\"\nThe Census Bureau agrees.\n\"We tell people: Put your name down on the census form.\nWe won't report you to the housing authority {if there are too many occupants},\" says Peter Bonpanne, an assistant director.\n\"If they see a lot of questions on there about somebody's legal status, that could hurt all kinds of people's participation.\"\nAlthough the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if Congress acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, Mr. Bonpanne says.\nThe bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens.\nTo satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn't a citizen.\nRep. Ridge dismisses the practical problems.\n\"We're spending billions on the census, and the only thing we get is a bunch of belly-aching about how difficult it will be,\" he complains.\n\"The primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power . . .\nnot to gather demographic information.\"\nThe Senate, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment.\nBecause California, Texas and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the House, the House has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants.\nThe House did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from \"knowingly\" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds.\n<highlight_start>All sides<highlight_end> in the debate <highlight_start>predict a lawsuit<highlight_end> no matter what Congress does.\n<highlight_start>In 1980, a federal appeals court upheld a<highlight_end> lower-<highlight_start>court decision<highlight_end> throwing out a suit that sought to bar the government from <highlight_start>counting illegal immigrants<highlight_end>.\n<highlight_start>A similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district<highlight_end> judge in Pittsburgh <highlight_start>ruled<highlight_end> that the states that sued -- Pennsylvania, Kansas and Alabama -- couldn't show they had been harmed.\nThe Constitution simply calls for apportioning the House on the basis of the \"the whole number of persons\" in each state.\nThe Constitution originally called for counting \"free persons\" and indentured servants, and for counting slaves as three-fifths of a person.\nThat was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868.\nOnly \"Indians not taxed\" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since 1940.\nMuch of the argument in Congress turns on the use of the word \"person\" in references to the census.\nElsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word \"citizen.\"\nThey wrote, for instance, that only those who have been \"seven years a citizen of the United States\" can serve in the House.\nThe word \"person\" was repeated in the 14th Amendment, which was drafted after the Civil War.\nThose in Congress and at the Census Bureau who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the U.S. conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate.\nTheir opponents say the drafters of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment never even considered the concept of an \"illegal immigrant,\" let alone contemplated their current numbers. --- @ Estimates of Illegal Aliens @ Counted in 1980 Census @ TOTAL U.S. 2,057,000 @ California 1,024,000 @ New York 234,000 @ Texas 186,000 @ Illinois 135,000 @ Florida 80,000 @

That meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia. \"You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals,\" says Rep.

The bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens. To satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn't a citizen. Rep.

The Census Bureau estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980 That meant one extra seat for California and New York Organizations that represent Hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign They fear that any attempt will exacerbate difficulties the Census Bureau already faces in accurately counting Hispanics and blacks the 106 million census forms can be reprinted wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge", "unhighlights_concatenation": "Though the forms for the 1990 census are already at the printers, Congress is contemplating adding a question: Are you an illegal immigrant?  , as it has in the past,   regardless of legal status. But   already has  A majority of the members of the House of Representatives has signaled support. \"It is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced,\" Rep. Thomas Petri (R., Wis.) said in a recent House debate. Replied Rep. Jim Kolbe (R., Ariz.): \"A very clear reading of the Constitution says that we shall count all those who are present.\" Although the debate is often couched in constitutional arguments, it's largely driven by geography. Wisconsin has few illegal immigrants; Arizona has lots. \"It boils down to regional politics,\" says Arturo Vargas, census-program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants. Counting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat in the House for Pennsylvania and one more for California, according to the private Population Reference Bureau. The Census Bureau's chief antagonist in the Senate, Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), says seats for Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina and Alabama also are at risk. On the other hand, Texas, Florida and New York could benefit. \"Illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from Americans,\" says David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform.  , based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service,  , half of them in California.   in the House   and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia. \"You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals,\" says Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.), who leads the charge against the practice in the House.   to ascertain the legal status of respondents  . \"As it is, the Census Bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential,\" Mr. Vargas says. \"If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that's going to be even harder.\" The Census Bureau agrees. \"We tell people: Put your name down on the census form. We won't report you to the housing authority {if there are too many occupants},\" says Peter Bonpanne, an assistant director. \"If they see a lot of questions on there about somebody's legal status, that could hurt all kinds of people's participation.\" Although   if Congress acts soon,  , Mr. Bonpanne says. The bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens. To satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn't a citizen. Rep. Ridge dismisses the practical problems. \"We're spending billions on the census, and the only thing we get is a bunch of belly-aching about how difficult it will be,\" he complains. \"The primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power . . . not to gather demographic information.\" The Senate, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment. Because California, Texas and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the House, the House has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants. The House did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from \"knowingly\" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds. All sides in the debate predict a lawsuit no matter what Congress does. In 1980, a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court decision throwing out a suit that sought to bar the government from counting illegal immigrants. A similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district judge in Pittsburgh ruled that the states that sued -- Pennsylvania, Kansas and Alabama -- couldn't show they had been harmed. The Constitution simply calls for apportioning the House on the basis of the \"the whole number of persons\" in each state. The Constitution originally called for counting \"free persons\" and indentured servants, and for counting slaves as three-fifths of a person. That was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868. Only \"Indians not taxed\" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since 1940. Much of the argument in Congress turns on the use of the word \"person\" in references to the census. Elsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word \"citizen.\" They wrote, for instance, that only those who have been \"seven years a citizen of the United States\" can serve in the House. The word \"person\" was repeated in the 14th Amendment, which was drafted after the Civil War. Those in Congress and at the Census Bureau who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the U.S. conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate. Their opponents say the drafters of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment never even considered the concept of an \"illegal immigrant,\" let alone contemplated their current numbers. --- @ Estimates of Illegal Aliens @ Counted in 1980 Census @ TOTAL U.S. 2,057,000 @ California 1,024,000 @ New York 234,000 @ Texas 186,000 @ Illinois 135,000 @ Florida 80,000 @ Source: Census Bureau"}

Estey, a cancer researcher at the University of Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.\nDr. Estey recently began treating patients with 2-CdA and has had similar results with five patients.\n\"It's a striking finding,\" he says.\n\"It's very unlikely to be a fluke.\"\nHairy-cell leukemia, so-called because of the appearance of the cancerous cells under the microscope, affects about 6,000 people in the U.S., with 600 new cases a year.\nAs the disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to infection and often need blood transfusions.\nUntil the mid-1980s, treatments were ineffective, and patients often died of blood problems and infections.\nSince then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from hairy-cell leukemia.\nHoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary of F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. of Switzerland.\nBut neither drug is as effective as 2-CdA appears to be in low doses and both can cause such side effects as nausea, vomiting, skin rashes and nervous-system disorders, researchers say.\n\"With the lack of toxicity and the ease with which people go into remission {with 2-CdA}, I think there's something really going on here,\" says Ellin Berman, a staff leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York.\nScripps said it negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., to produce and distribute 2-CdA to other centers for broader clinical trials.\nThe researchers said <highlight_start>the drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive<highlight_end> than other cancer treatments.\n<highlight_start>In the 12-patient study, 2-CdA<highlight_end>, short for 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, <highlight_start>was administered<highlight_end> continuously <highlight_start>for seven days to patients<highlight_end> aged 36 to 61.\n<highlight_start>Within eight to 10 weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their blood or bone marrow<highlight_end>; the 12th had a small amount remaining in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow monitoring, Dr. Piro said.\nHis blood tests are normal, Dr. Piro added.\n<highlight_start>None of the patients have had<highlight_end> a relapse; complete remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment, according to the study.\n\"When you can make all the disease go away with a single infusion of therapy, you have a disease which may be able to be cured,\" Dr. Piro said.\nBut because hairy-cell leukemia proliferates slowly, a relapse could occur long after treatment.\nLonger follow-up is necessary to determine whether 2-CdA actually cures the disease.\nThe drug was first made about 10 years ago at Scripps by Dennis A. Carson, who studied severe combined immunodeficiency disease, made famous a few years ago by the Texas boy that lived in a bubble.\nPeople with that disease lack an enzyme that processes deoxyadenosine, a chemical that, without the enzyme, builds up in infection-fighting white blood cells and kills them.\nSince cancer patients have the enzyme, Scripps scientists developed a compound that mimics deoxyadenosine, but tricks the enzyme so it can't be processed.\nThe compound then kills the white blood cells, including those that are cancerous.\nNew, normal white cells are then generated in the bone marrow.\nBecause hairy-cell leukemia is rare, a 12-patient study \"is considered a pretty good series,\" says Sloan-Kettering's Dr. Berman.\n\"It's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments.\"\n<highlight_start>Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia<highlight_end>, non-Hodgkins lymphoma <highlight_start>and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma<highlight_end>.\nAbout 50% to 60% of patients -- most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the drug, some with complete remission, he said.\n\"Now, we will use {2-CdA} as a first treatment to see if response and remission are higher,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, researchers at University of California at San Francisco are testing 2-CdA on AIDS-related lymphoma.", "gold_summary": "A new cancer drug called 2-CdA proved nearly 100% effective treating 12 patients with hairy cell leukemia.\nThe patients underwent just a seven day treatment and suffered almost none of the usual debilitating side effects associated with chemotherapy, yet, they have been disease free for four years.\nResults must be replicated by other researchers before definitive conclusions can be made.\nThe drug is easy to produce and likely to be less expensive.\nDr. Lawrence Piro of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation said it has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common forms of leukemia.", "highlights": [{"text": "The results need to be replicated by other researchers before definitive conclusions can be made", "score": 0.133}, {"text": "Lawrence Piro, chief of cancer research at Scripps Clinic", "score": 0.08}, {"text": "Research Foundation", "score": 0.018}, {"text": "effective treatment for hairy-cell leukemia", "score": 0.053}, {"text": "the drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive", "score": 0.124}, {"text": "In the 12-patient study, 2-CdA", "score": 0.062}, {"text": "was administered", "score": 0.018}, {"text": "for seven days to patients", "score": 0.044}, {"text": "Within eight to 10 weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their blood or bone marrow", "score": 0.177}, {"text": "None of the patients have had", "score": 0.053}, {"text": "Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia", "score": 0.195}, {"text": "and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma", "score": 0.044}], "unhighlights": [{"text": "long-term effect of the treatment remains unknown", "score": 0.012}, {"text": "initial experience with the compound is especially promising", "score": 0.012}, {"text": "apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease, scientists said", "score": 0.015}, {"text": "apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease", "score": 0.012}, {"text": "scientists said", "score": 0.003}, {"text": "There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment", "score": 0.02}, {"text": "you can administer one course of treatment", "score": 0.011}, {"text": "There aren't many {drugs} where", "score": 0.009}, {"text": "have the disease go away", "score": 0.008}, {"text": "disease go away", "score": 0.005}, {"text": "stay away for as long as four years,\" says", "score": 0.014}, {"text": "stay away for as long as four years", "score": 0.012}, {"text": "says", "score": 0.002}, {"text": "amp", "score": 0.002}, {"text": "La Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed", "score": 0.012}, {"text": "drug was developed", "score": 0.005}, {"text": "La Jolla, Calif., where", "score": 0.006}, {"text": "leukemia hasn't come back in any of the patients we treated", "score": 0.018}, {"text": "we treated", "score": 0.003}, {"text": "leukemia hasn't come back in any of the patients", "score": 0.015}, {"text": "study is published in today's New England Journal of Medicine", "score": 0.017}, {"text": "It is without doubt the most", "score": 0.009}, {"text": "terms of rapidity of response,\" adds Elihu H.

drug is easy to produce and thus is likely to be less expensive In the 12-patient study, 2-CdA was administered for seven days to patients Within eight to 10 weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their blood or bone marrow None of the patients have had Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in initial trials to treat more common cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma", "unhighlights_concatenation": ", and the long-term effect of the treatment remains unknown. But the initial experience with the compound is especially promising, and an apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease, scientists said. \"There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay away for as long as four years,\" says   &amp;  , La Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed. \"The leukemia hasn't come back in any of the patients we treated.\" The study is published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. \"It is without doubt the most  , in terms of rapidity of response,\" adds Elihu H. Estey, a cancer researcher at the University of Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. Dr. Estey recently began treating patients with 2-CdA and has had similar results with five patients. \"It's a striking finding,\" he says. \"It's very unlikely to be a fluke.\" Hairy-cell leukemia, so-called because of the appearance of the cancerous cells under the microscope, affects about 6,000 people in the U.S., with 600 new cases a year. As the disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to infection and often need blood transfusions. Until the mid-1980s, treatments were ineffective, and patients often died of blood problems and infections. Since then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from hairy-cell leukemia. Hoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary of F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. of Switzerland. But neither drug is as effective as 2-CdA appears to be in low doses and both can cause such side effects as nausea, vomiting, skin rashes and nervous-system disorders, researchers say. \"With the lack of toxicity and the ease with which people go into remission {with 2-CdA}, I think there's something really going on here,\" says Ellin Berman, a staff leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. Scripps said it negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., to produce and distribute 2-CdA to other centers for broader clinical trials. The researchers said   than other cancer treatments.  , short for 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine,   continuously   aged 36 to 61.  ; the 12th had a small amount remaining in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow monitoring, Dr. Piro said. His blood tests are normal, Dr. Piro added.   a relapse; complete remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment, according to the study. \"When you can make all the disease go away with a single infusion of therapy, you have a disease which may be able to be cured,\" Dr. Piro said. But because hairy-cell leukemia proliferates slowly, a relapse could occur long after treatment. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether 2-CdA actually cures the disease. The drug was first made about 10 years ago at Scripps by Dennis A. Carson, who studied severe combined immunodeficiency disease, made famous a few years ago by the Texas boy that lived in a bubble. People with that disease lack an enzyme that processes deoxyadenosine, a chemical that, without the enzyme, builds up in infection-fighting white blood cells and kills them. Since cancer patients have the enzyme, Scripps scientists developed a compound that mimics deoxyadenosine, but tricks the enzyme so it can't be processed. The compound then kills the white blood cells, including those that are cancerous. New, normal white cells are then generated in the bone marrow. Because hairy-cell leukemia is rare, a 12-patient study \"is considered a pretty good series,\" says Sloan-Kettering's Dr. Berman. \"It's ironic that we have three active drugs for a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments.\"  , non-Hodgkins lymphoma  . About 50% to 60% of patients -- most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the drug, some with complete remission, he said. \"Now, we will use {2-CdA} as a first treatment to see if response and remission are higher,\" he said. Meanwhile, researchers at University of California at San Francisco are testing 2-CdA on AIDS-related lymphoma."}
